<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch01' class='c007'>CHAPTER I<br /> <br />INTRODUCTORY</h2>
</div>
<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>There</span> are a great many people in the world
who are interested in Egypt, in its antiquities,
and in the unfolding of its pages of
ancient history; a number collect specimens
of old Egyptian art, such as scarabs, pottery,
small statues, &amp;c., and others, when in Egypt,
buy them as presents for friends at home.</p>
<p class='c008'>It is for this numerous class, which is year
by year defrauded of large sums of money
by the plausible sellers of forged antiquities,
that this book has been written, for most
of them, sooner or later, find out to their
dismay that that which they had thought
was a genuine relic of ancient days, and
prized accordingly, is nothing more nor less
than a clever fraud, and, from a collector’s
point of view, worthless. The Egyptologist,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>museum authority, and expert collector may
be safely left to take care of themselves; a
perusal of the following pages might even
prove interesting to them, although it is
exceedingly unlikely that the book contains
anything new so far as they are concerned.</p>

<p class='c008'>The selling of spurious Egyptian antiquities
is not confined to Egypt alone.
London, New York, Paris, and even Algiers,
are also the hunting-ground of the makers
of imitations, who often make large sums of
money by imposing upon those who do not
possess the knowledge requisite to detect the
fraud.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is interesting to analyse the frame of
mind of the people who have been cheated.
As a rule, they are angry, but they are
extremely careful to keep their feelings to
themselves. If you inquire, they pooh-pooh
the transaction as one of little moment,
and pass it over, although, as I shall presently
show, many pounds may have been
lost. But if the conversation is not changed,
and you wait patiently, you will presently
find that under the carefully repressed annoyance
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>runs a vein of genuine regret that the
nice-spoken, honest-looking and plausible
Hassan or Mohammed had cheated them.</p>

<p class='c008'>The subsequent history of the fraudulent
antiquity is often interesting. As a rule,
it is packed up and taken home, to be presented
in due course to some friend with
the cautious remark that “perhaps it is
genuine.” Then some day an unfortunate
Egyptologist is brought face to face with
it, and he has to make his escape as best he
may, with a certain loss of reputation. I
have heard a hostess remark sarcastically
that she did not know what post was held
by her victim in the Antiquities Department
in Egypt, but it certainly did not
require a clever man to see that hers was
an important antiquity.</p>

<p class='c008'>There is no more trying moment in an
Egyptologist’s life than when, after a good
dinner, while he is feeling at peace with all
the world, a charming hostess brings out
an antiquity for him to pass judgment upon.
I have seen men literally squirm, and many
are the subterfuges employed by them to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>avoid giving an opinion. Woe betide the unhappy
expert if a mischievous friend happens
to be there who will lead their hostess on to
ask questions, and who will assure her,
despite mute appeals, that her victim is an
expert in the particular branch to which
her statue or jar, as it may be, belongs. And
when the Egyptologist is cornered, and
huffily declares to be a forgery the object
upon which he is asked to pass judgment,
the lady is, as a rule, angry or hurt; and
then it is that the mischievous friend saves
the situation by murmuring, “How shocking
that these Egyptologists should be so
jealous!” The straw is caught, the hostess
smiles again, and peace is restored, while
the unfortunate man from Egypt, vowing
vengeance, makes his escape.</p>

<p class='c008'>If a buyer of some specimen wishes an
expert opinion upon his purchase, he usually
lays a deep plan. Perhaps he knows a man
connected with the museum, whose opinion
is worth having; or, if not, he gets some
one to introduce him. Then, one day, in
a casual off-hand kind of way, he produces
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>his specimen, and explains that he did not
buy it as a “real thing, you know,” but
it seemed very clever, and he did not pay
much for it. Inquiries as to how much
has been paid are met by “regrets that he
has forgotten—it was so unimportant.”
Most probably it was pounds, but the buyer
will seldom or never tell you.</p>

<p class='c008'>The expert groans, but cannot escape.
The clever ones temporise, and tell tales of
the marvellous cleverness of the forgers, and
explain that it is almost impossible to distinguish
some forgeries from genuine antiquities.
Then come other stories of how such and
such a one was taken in, and names are
mentioned which stand high in the list of
savants. It is assumed by the expert that
his friend will never mention the matter.
Then he expresses the opinion that it would
be very difficult to be certain in the case
of the specimen under consideration, that
he himself would not like to say definitely,
“and you know, my dear fellow, it has
become almost impossible to tell, for these
things are made by the descendants of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>men who made the originals.” So the
friendship is preserved, and the subject
drifts away into the safe region of “perhaps
and if.”</p>

<p class='c008'>It does not seem to occur to the general
public that so great has been the demand
for antiquities on the part of foreign museums,
private collectors, and learned societies all
over the world that the supply may threaten
to give out; that the districts in which the
relics lie are carefully watched; and that
the Cairo museum is a jealous guardian. So
important are the links between the past
and the present times that stringent laws
have been passed against unauthorised
persons taking genuine and important relics
out of the country. Moreover, the enormous
numbers of antiquities sold yearly
would require extensive expeditions to supply
the demand, and few of the finds are obtained
surreptitiously.</p>

<p class='c008'>In fact, since the above was written, an
even more stringent law has been passed by
the Egyptian Government, which took effect
on July 1, 1912. Under this law all finds of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>examples of the Arts, Sciences, Literature,
Religions, Customs, Industries, &amp;c., will
belong to the State. The definition of the
term Antiquities is most comprehensive, and
covers every possible find.</p>

<p class='c008'>All dealers will now require to have a
licence, the export of antiquities is quite prohibited
unless by special permit from the
department responsible, and any attempt to
evade this law will be followed by the confiscation
of the objects.</p>

<p class='c008'>Any one discovering antiquities must
notify the Antiquities Department at once;
should the articles found be of a movable
nature the finder will receive half the objects
discovered or their value in money.</p>

<p class='c008'>A licence from the Ministry of Public
Works, issued with the consent of the
Director of the Antiquities Department,
must be obtained before any excavation may
be undertaken.</p>

<p class='c008'>This new law is sure to give a great impetus
to the manufacture of forged Egyptian
antiquities.</p>

<p class='c008'>There is indeed a great fascination in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>possessing jewels, beads, necklaces, vases,
and statues belonging to a people who lived
thousands of years ago, but it is obvious
that there must be a limit to the quantity
available. As the supply becomes less, so
the prices rise; for the demand does not
fall off, and to-day £30 or £40 will be paid
for a specimen which, a few years ago,
would hardly have brought in as many
shillings. The intrinsic value of these antiquities
is very little. They are prized for
their association with the past and as evidences
of the advanced state of culture
existing in those far-off days.</p>

<p class='c008'>The love of money has always been a
marked characteristic of the Egyptian, and
here the ingenuity of the descendant of the
old craftsman asserts itself. There is no
doubt that he has, from time to time, been
assisted by various Europeans, but he is
producing replicas of antiquities, scarabs,
figures, models, so cleverly cut and made
that it puzzles many of the best experts to
say whether they are false or real. Some
of these imitations are sold for very high
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>prices. If the discovery of a fraud is made
in time, part of the money will sometimes
be refunded.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Egyptian forger would not consider
that he had done anything particularly
dishonest in deceiving a man in that kind of
way. His only regret would be that the
fraud had been discovered, and he would
muse upon the unfairness of Fate, for here
he had been with a fortune within his grasp,
only to lose it.</p>

<p class='c008'>Such cases are seldom brought before the
courts, for there seems to be a tacit understanding
between the buyer and seller whereby
each accepts his own risk.</p>

<p class='c008'>Think for a moment what such a transaction
means to the Egyptian. Supposing he
got £3000 for certain objects and made £2500
clear profit: that would mean at least
twenty feddans of land, probably more.
These should bring him, if he lets them out
for hire, over £200 a year; or, if he farmed
them himself, £600 or £700 a year. It is a
perfect craze with the Egyptians to get rich,
and perhaps our forger has been earning
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>a precarious living for years, receiving in
pay the equivalent of a shilling or two a day.
He has always kept in mind the possibility
of making a coup such as I have described.
He has worked hard and cultivated a plausible
manner and learned English with this
single object in view. If he is successful,
and the fraud is not discovered until too
late, he will occupy a high position in his
village and will live happily, but always
with the hope of making a further haul.</p>

<p class='c008'>To such a pitch has the art of manufacturing
imitations been carried that I propose
to give a few of the more common examples,
and here I may say that the morality of
dealing in antiquities resembles, to a great
extent, that involved in the buying and
selling of horses. If you go to a respectable
and responsible dealer, you pay more, but
you are sure either to get a genuine article
or to have your money returned if things
go wrong. But if you go to a horse coper,
you buy at your own risk.</p>

  <h2 id='ch02' class='c007'>CHAPTER II<br /> <br />GOLD ORNAMENTS</h2>
</div>
<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>The</span> making of copies of ancient gold ornaments
has been going on for some years,
and is one of the most lucrative branches
of the business. The most extraordinary
prices are sometimes paid for these replicas
in the full belief that they are genuine.</p>
<p class='c008'>A gentleman who is deeply interested
in the study of Egyptology was once approached
by a native, who, after some
conversation, hinted that he had some gold
antiquities to sell. The interpreter, who
was evidently “in the swim,” pretended to
have the utmost difficulty in persuading
the native that he might speak freely,
assuring him that he was quite safe—the
gentleman would not inform against him—and
that he could with perfect confidence
bring his spoils to be looked at. This at
last he agreed to do.</p>

<p class='c008'>Excitement grew, and at the hour the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>man appeared—a stolid, clownish, apparently
ignorant fellah; he seemed the last
one to be suspected of a clever fraud.</p>

<p class='c008'>The articles were various figures wrought
in gold, and after a protracted interview,
a bargain was struck. £3000 was paid for
them, and then they were brought in triumph
to Cairo, where I saw them. They were
submitted to expert after expert, and then
the truth came out. They were forgeries.
Part of the money paid was returned, but
the remainder was lost.</p>

<p class='c008'>Another case occurred recently. A man
from the Delta went to a dealer in Cairo and
said that one of the farmers in his district
had found some gold things in a tomb while
taking soil from the ground, and now he
wanted to find a rich man to buy them, one
who would keep his secret so that the Government
should not punish him and take them
from him. When the dealer agreed to go
and see them, the man advised him to take
£200 or £300 with him. The dealer cautiously
said, “No, I shall take only £20.” It was
arranged that he should go to his informant’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>village, and that the finder of the jewels
should be brought to him there.</p>

<p class='c008'>Next day the dealer went to the village,
and found that his informant was out,
collecting rents for his land, and some time
elapsed before he came back, carrying in
his hands an inkpot and some papers to
show how busy he had been. The dealer
asked where the farmer was who had found
the antiquities. The man replied, “I have
sent for him, but he has not yet come.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Where does he live?” asked the dealer.</p>

<p class='c008'>The man pointed to a collection of huts
in the distance behind a ruin.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Come, let us take donkeys and ride
there,” said the dealer, “I cannot stay here
all day.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Donkeys were procured and they set off.
On arrival, they found the farmer working
his land. When he came in answer to their
call he refused to admit that he had ever
seen any gold antiquities, and vowed that
he had none. When pressed, he swore by
all the Prophets and their beards that he
was innocent of finding anything; but, in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>an aside, he muttered that he thought the
dealer was a member of the secret police,
who had come to take all he had got.</p>

<p class='c008'>Then the dealer swore to him by all the
most sacred oaths that he was not a member
of the police force, so the old man took
courage, and produced one piece—a leaf of
gold with two oxen engaged in a fight
stamped upon it. The dealer asked if this
was all. The farmer replied, “Well, you
buy this, and when I know how you value
it I will go and get you another.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Then the dealer, doubting if the specimen
was really genuine, asked the farmer if he
had found it, or whether any one had
given it to him to sell. The man swore
by the divorce—the <i>talak bi talata</i>—that
he had found the things himself, and had
dug them up out of the ground.</p>

<p class='c008'>The dealer thereupon bought some
stamped leaves of gold to the value of £30,
and the farmer told him to come again in
two days and perhaps he would show him
some more. Then the man who had lured
the dealer there said, “Oh, I have seen in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>this man’s house a gold sword and a gold
belt, and lots of coins, and if you can get
five thousand pounds you can buy them
from him.”</p>

<p class='c008'>When the dealer got back to Cairo with
his purchases, he showed them to an authority
on the subject, who offered to buy them
for £250, but the dealer refused, saying that
he wished to wait until he could buy the rest
of the find. Then the prospective purchaser
said that, as he had not time to wait, he
would ask a friend to come and buy for
him.</p>

<p class='c008'>The friend came and in the end bought the
gold leaves for £250, and asked the dealer
to go and get the rest of the things. Thinking
that he was going to make a good season’s
work, the dealer took £300 with him and
went back to the place. This was, in itself,
a risky proceeding, as he might have been
murdered and the money stolen; needless
to say, he did not sleep that night.</p>

<p class='c008'>The intermediary entered into an agreement
with the dealer that he would take
no money for introducing him to the finder,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>but would accept a commission on the
profits made when the articles were sold.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I will send for the man to come,” he
declared, “because people will see us going
to his house, and they will become suspicious
and inform the authorities, who will put
the man in prison or punish him in some
way. Stay here, my friend. It is better
so. I will send for the farmer to come.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But when will he come?” asked the
dealer.</p>

<p class='c008'>“In the night, when it is dark,” replied
the intermediary.</p>

<p class='c008'>The dealer waited and waited, and between
his fear of being killed and robbed, and his
anxiety to get more things, he had no sleep.
Each time the door opened—and it opened
many times—he sat up and asked if the
man had come.</p>

<p class='c008'>The reply was always, “No, not yet.”</p>

<p class='c008'>In the early morning the dealer became
suspicious and said, “Well, I must go home
now, I cannot wait any longer.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The intermediary said, “Yes, you go
home, and if the man brings anything I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>will come over to your shop and bring them
with me.”</p>

<p class='c008'>After two days he came alone, bringing
a gold ring with a Greek head upon it, and
asked the dealer for £10 in order to buy
some more things from the farmer, who had
grown suspicious and would not disclose
what else he had. The dealer gave the
money, and after two days the intermediary
returned, this time with two gold coins,
some more rings and stamped gold foil,
and saying positively that they were from
the same tomb.</p>

<p class='c008'>So the dealer bought the coins, rings,
and some of the other things for £80. He
took them to an expert authority, who said,
“This is excellent, for now we shall know
from the date on the coins the age of the
relics.”</p>

<p class='c008'>A stamp in wax was taken, and sent at
once to the museum.</p>

<p class='c008'>“May I show this coin to a friend?”
asked the expert. The dealer gladly gave
permission, and it was taken to a collector
of coins, who told them that that particular
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>coin was never found in Egypt, and, most
probably, it was not genuine.</p>

<p class='c008'>Then the dealer said, “Well, if this coin
is not real, then all the things which I have
bought are frauds; let us examine all of
them.”</p>

<p class='c008'>This was done, and after three hours’
hard work with magnifying glasses, the
expert came to the conclusion that the
articles were not really genuine antiquities,
but very clever frauds. Then the dealer
returned the £250 to his patron who had
bought the gold leaves. After this he took
the things straight back to the intermediary,
who now declined all responsibility,
saying, “You bought from the farmer, who
is an ignorant man and knows nothing.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The assistance of the police was invoked,
and the head of the village paid £20 to the
dealer, intending to reimburse himself from
the proceeds of the farmer’s crops.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the meantime, the dealer was not idle.
He found out that a Jewish goldsmith in
Cairo had prepared some plain gold leaves
and had sent them over to Athens to be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>stamped. He had then sold them to the
intermediary, and this man had passed
them on to the fellah, and between them
they had made this plan. They buried the
things in the ground, and after a time the
fellah dug them up, thus being able to swear
by the “triple divorce” that he had taken
them out of the ground. Then the intermediary
had looked about him for a promising
victim, and selected the dealer, who lost
over the transaction some £60. Some time
later, the forgeries were again sold to a
well-known man for £30, and were again
detected. This time the money in full was
returned, and the forgeries were melted
down.</p>

<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c008'>One night, thirteen years ago, while I was
strolling about in the moonlight after dinner,
an Arab came up, and after some conversation
slipped a small parcel into my hand,
made a sign of silence, and went away. I
knew the man, so, after a few minutes, I
made an excuse and went indoors to
look at the parcel, which was rather heavy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>and of a peculiar shape. After undoing
the knotted ends of a piece of native cloth,
there came into view a magnificent pair of
gold bracelets made in the form of snakes,
with three rings of heavy gold. The make
was antique and the design splendid. I was
young at the game then, and the beauty of
the bracelets made them attractive. I hesitated
for a time, and the more I hesitated
the less I liked the idea of buying them.
I could not be sure that they were real, and
an expert opinion could not, under the circumstances,
be got, to say nothing of the
questionable morality of buying them and
thereby encouraging riflers of tombs and
stealers of important links between the
present and ancient days. For who can
say what valuable pieces of evidence may
not, in this way, be lost?</p>

<p class='c008'>I wrapped them up again in their dirty cloth
and went out into the moonlight once more.
Soon the Arab sidled up to me, and I put
the parcel back into his hand.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You will buy them?” he queried.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What is your price?” I asked.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>“Thirty pounds,” he replied. “They are
worth a hundred and fifty.”</p>

<p class='c008'>I told him it was a lot of money. He
shrugged his shoulders, and held up his
hands as if to show me that he was positively
giving them to me. Then I definitely
declined to buy them.</p>

<p class='c008'>And now, after thirteen years have
passed, I hear that they were afterwards
sold for the price of the gold plus a
quarter for the antique design. Old Egyptian
gold is 24 carat, and an English sovereign
is 18 carat, so that the price came out at
about the price of ordinary gold. And one
of those implicated in the transaction has
since admitted to me that the bracelets
were forgeries.</p>

<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c008'>Last year I was shown by a collector a
small gold scarab. It was quite hollow and
made of very thin gold, and it had the
appearance of having been pressed out in a
mould. I was asked to give an opinion on it,
but was able to escape without committing
myself. My opinion was that the scarab
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>was not genuine, but as it was the first
example of its kind that I had seen, I did
not care to express too definite an opinion
upon the subject. This year I have seen
other gold ornaments bought at the same
place, and I have no hesitation in saying
that the scarab was an exceedingly well-made
copy of a genuine one.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p class='c008'>In Plate II are shown some interesting
forged gold antiques. The necklace (No. 2)
was bought by a lady in Algiers. It was
represented to have been brought from Egypt,
and was said to be composed of Egyptian
scarabs made of precious stones and mounted
in gold filigree work. The price paid for it
was £16. Examination showed that the
scarabs were composed of coloured glass,
very badly cut, and the setting was merely
silver gilt. The real value was under ten
shillings.</p>

<p class='c008'>No. 1 shows a combination necklace
composed of genuine old carnelian beads
and spurious gold bottles. This was a
fashionable form of necklace in the ancient
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>days, and the present specimen is extremely
well calculated to take in the unwary. The
price asked for it was £18. The man had
two others of a somewhat different design
with him. The prices were £12 and £6
respectively. In each case the beads were
old, and the gold had been covered with a
kind of lacquer which gave it the appearance
of age. So clever were the gold imitations
that at first I really thought that they were
real, and proceeded to bargain for them.
We did not agree upon a price for the two
largest necklaces, but I bought the smaller
one (No. 4) for twelve shillings.</p>

<p class='c008'>No. 3 is a bracelet made up of imitation
scarabs set in real gold of a low carat.</p>

<p class='c008'>The seller also showed me a heavy gold
ring, fashioned like the ring of Akhnaton,
but lacking an inscription on the face of it.
For this he asked £8, but I remembered
a tale told me by an excavator to the effect
that in December of 1900 a man of Qus
took a gold ring to his camp at Derr-el-Ballas.
On the face was the name of an
eighteenth-dynasty queen. Careful examination
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>showed that the ring was a forgery.
Four months later the excavator saw the
same ring in the shop of a dealer in Luxor,
who had paid £5 for it, and this made me
cautious. The following day the man
returned with a friend, and again we proceeded
to bargain for the two large necklaces.
Hamid Ibrahim, to whom I am
much indebted for his assistance, and in
whose shop the transaction was taking place,
was suspicious and uneasy. Time after time
he examined the necklaces with a powerful
magnifying glass. The men watched him
calmly, never showing by the quiver of an
eyelid that they minded his examining them
as much as he liked. We had narrowed the
transaction down until now there was little
separating us in price, when again Ibrahim
took up the bottle necklace, and began
looking at it with his glass. Suddenly he
made a quick movement which I understood
at once, and then he laid the necklace
down. Silently he handed me the glass,
and pointed out a bottle. I took up the
necklace, and there on the bottle he had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>indicated, was a very fine line where the
gold had been folded over. I handed the
necklace back to Ibrahim, who took a needle
and ran it along underneath the edge of
the gold, which he thus turned back. Then
we saw that it was no thicker than a sheet
of thin paper, while the bottles had been
cast in plaster of Paris, and the gold foil
very cleverly folded over them. I did not
buy the necklaces, but I obtained the loan
of one of them (No. 2, <a href='#plate-02'>Plate II</a>).</p>

<p class='c008'>As I have said, the men made no objection
to our examination of the bottles. They
looked us frankly in the face; they would
have cheated us if they could, but they had
failed. They did not consider that they
were in any way to blame for their attempt.
They told us frankly, after we had found
them out, that the gold forgeries were all
made by one man, who was such a wonderful
artist that he had been offered a high rate
of pay to go to Europe to work there, but
that he had refused. It is certain that more
will be heard of this man’s work, for, said
my informant, “There is no one in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>world so clever as he is in making gold
imitations.”</p>

<p class='c008'>I have purposely refrained from describing
the gold forgeries made and sold by Europeans
in Egypt, preferring to keep entirely to the
Egyptians and their work.</p>

  <h2 id='ch03' class='c007'>CHAPTER III<br /> <br />LAPIS LAZULI FIGURES AND<br />IRIDESCENT GLASS</h2>
</div>
<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>Genuine</span> lapis lazuli figures are extremely
rare, and generally small, the most valuable
ones in the museums being only a few inches
high. It was thought at first that it would
be impossible to make imitations which
would pass for the real stone, but on the
demand arising it has been met.</p>
<p class='c008'>I was riding from Deir-el-Bahari down
to the river one day when a youth rose
up from the side of the road, and shuffled
forward to speak to me.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You buy antīcas?” he said in a whisper,
casting a sidelong glance of apprehension
at a mounted policeman who was following
at about seventy yards distance.</p>

<p class='c008'>I told him to show me what he had,
whereupon he produced a blue bowl of
earthenware with a pattern of the lotus
flower on it. Porcelain, he called it, “and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>very fine work, sir. I dig in the tombs,
sir.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Now if there was one thing that this
youthful Ananias did not do, it was to dig
in the tombs. It is one of the worst offences
in Egypt to dig and take away antiquities
without permission. This constitutes a
crime not to be expiated without years of
imprisonment in the Tourah stone quarries.</p>

<p class='c008'>The price of the blue bowl was £3. This
at once betrayed it, for no one knows
better than these sellers of antiquities the
value of the genuine article. £20 or more
would not have bought it, had he really
dug it up out of a tomb. When I declined
to buy the bowl, he produced various fragments
of alabaster vessels which were genuine
enough, and then some odd Ushebti figures,
genuine but very poor in make and colour,
and not worth the trouble of taking home.
When these were declined, he still ran alongside
of my donkey for perhaps half a mile,
from time to time casting hunted looks at
the mounted policeman not very far away.
Presently he cast an agonised look at me
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>and made a sound indicative of silence;
then he produced a statue bound up in old
rags, thrust it on my saddle in front of me,
and with exceedingly well-acted fright,
implored me not to let the policeman see
it. Our conversation was carried on in
Arabic, so that he knew well that I lived
in the country, and yet he looked me
straight in the face, and with his hand on
his heart, lied.</p>

<p class='c008'>I unrolled the rags, and there was a
wonderful statue of Horus, about six inches
high, beautifully moulded, in what was
apparently lapis lazuli, with most natural
cracks and fissures running through the
substance. It was the first time I had
met with this particular imitation, and
for a moment I was dumfounded. I
thrust the statue under my coat, and
turned to look at our friend, the policeman.
He was still at the same distance
away, watching us, but the smile had
broadened on his face, and this gave the
whole thing away. He had evidently witnessed
the same play a dozen times before,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>and perhaps a dozen people had thrust that
statue under their coats, and turned to look
at him; so that he knew at once the stage
which the negotiations had reached. Sometimes
the young man would bring off the
coup, when, no doubt, they would celebrate
the occasion in a manner which would
recompense the policeman for his non-interference.</p>

<p class='c008'>“How much?” I asked.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Thirty pounds,” was his reply.</p>

<p class='c008'>“But it is very dear,” I objected, “and
it does not seem to be a genuine antiquity.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“By the Prophet,” swore the boy, “I
dug it up myself in the tombs. Please,
gentleman, do not let the policeman see.”</p>

<p class='c008'>His intense anxiety was well acted. I
looked at the statue again. It was the work
of an artist, made in glass, with all the characteristics
of the precious stone, and then
sand-blasted to give it the appearance of
age. Its value, had it been genuine, would
have been many hundreds of pounds. Its
actual value was a few shillings. Then we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>proceeded to bargain. I could have bought
the figure for £3, but lower than that he
would not come down; so I wrapped the
statue up, and gave it back to him. Again
he tried to sell me the blue bowl, offering
this time to take ten shillings for it. When
I said that I had no change, he produced
a bag with a considerable quantity of gold
and silver in it, and extracted an English
half-sovereign. His perseverance was so
marked that in the end I bought a few
imitations, so that he might not have had
his long run for nothing.</p>

<p class='c008'>On returning to Luxor, I found in a shop
a large head of Horus in blue, apparently
lapis lazuli. It was in a glass case, and
was evidently considered to be very valuable.
I asked to see it, and inquired from
the dealer what it was. He, decent old
fellow, smiled, and, turning his hands upwards,
mentioned the name of a well-known
Egyptologist, connected with the museum,
and said, “He says perhaps it is lapis
lazuli.” As a matter of fact, it was glass
imitation.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>At the last Agricultural Show in Cairo,
there were several stalls for the sale of antiquities.
At one of these I was shown
Hathor, the sacred cow, and the figure of
a man. The price asked was £40 for the
cow, and £30 for the figure of a man.
They were both wrapped up in pieces of
old rag, and only brought out after I had
seen most of the antiquities on the stall.
After informing the man that I knew they
were only glass imitations, I tried to buy the
figures, but it was impossible to get them
for a reasonable sum. The lowest amount
he would accept for the cow was £8, and
£4 for the man.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Later on, an itinerant vendor offered to
sell me the figure shown in <a href='#plate-10'>Plate X.</a>, No. 4.
When we had agreed that it was imitation,
and made of glass, I asked him to name a
price. The lowest that he would take was
£3. I was somewhat puzzled by the consistent
high prices asked even for a fraud
which had been detected, and after a great
deal of argument, the man indignantly
informed me that some men from America
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>come each year to Cairo, at the end
of the season, and purchase these blue
glass figures for sums ranging between £3
and £7. They take them back to America,
where they are sold for very high prices—my
informant mentioned £50 and £100
each. This would quite explain why they
refused to sell them to me at their intrinsic
value.</p>

<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c008'>There is a very considerable market for
old iridescent glass. A small bottle will
fetch from £1 to £3, and good specimens
from £2 to £8. There is a moderate quantity
of these bottles found in a district called
Rakah. The bottles are extremely fragile,
but good specimens are very beautiful
objects and find quick buyers. There is
a demand, and the ingenuity of the Egyptian
is keenly exercised to meet it. Imitations
are being made by pouring a chemical on
the inside and the outside of specially made
thin bottles and glasses. This forms a film
which gives an appearance of iridescence;
but in many cases the film can be detached
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>with the point of a knife, and thus the fraud
is made palpable.</p>

<p class='c008'>One day a youth brought an iridescent
bottle for me to buy, and as I happened
to be out he sat down in the sun and
waited. Upon my return he came up and
began to explain that he had brought a
beautiful bottle to sell to me, but had sat
upon it and smashed it. Now he would
sell it to me very cheap. Bottles made of
iridescent glass are very thin, and the fragments
were quite useless, but day after day
the boy haunted the place, wanting to sell
me the broken bottle “very cheap.” I
much regretted the unfortunate accident,
for the bottle, though small, had been of
perfect shape and beautiful colour. At last
I offered to buy another should he have one
for sale, but he walked sullenly away and
never came back.</p>

He would look up with a sort of admiration
and say, “Nothing is hid from his Excellency.
He knows everything, even the mind of his
servant.” Later on, when I told him that
the smell of the wood of which the figures
were made was new, and not old, he looked
me straight in the face without changing
countenance and exclaimed, “Allah kerim!
[God is merciful.] I said well that nothing
was hid from his Excellency. If he does not
see that which is false with his eyes, he smells

<p class='c008'>About a week later, my servant told me
that “the man belonging to the antiquities”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>was waiting to see me. It was my friend
again, and he said, “This time I have an
antiquity of the highest value.” We proceeded
to a room to examine it, and there
he produced a bundle of paper which he
began to unroll; and as he neared the end,
a most appalling stink arose, a curious,
penetrating, abominable odour. I drew
back while he finished the unwrapping, and
presently he held up the wooden figure of
Anubis (<a href='#plate-03'>Plate III</a>, No. 4). It was extremely
light, and evidently made of mummy-case
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>wood, which is occasionally used for these
wooden figures. But the smell was so awful
that I quickly pushed it as far as possible
away from me. All the time the man
watched my face without the flicker of a
smile on his own.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It is indeed an antīca,” he assured me.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I have my doubts on that point,” I
replied.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Then will not the gentleman apply his
test and smell it?” asked my friend, with
the ghost of a smile on his face.</p>

<p class='c008'>No, the gentleman would not smell it.
The odour pervaded the whole room as it
was, and I verily believe the old scoundrel
had boiled down a piece of mummy and
painted the statue with the liquid, either
to hide the smell of the new wood, or to
play off a joke upon me. Finally I bought
the thing for three shillings, although he had
asked £14 for it; but I had to cover it all
over with varnish to seal up the smell before
I could keep it in my room. For that reason
it appears rather more shiny than the other
figures.</p>

<p class='c008'><a href='#plate-03'>Plate III</a>, No. 6 represents a Nubian of an
early dynasty. There is a cartouche and an
inscription on the base. It stood in the
window of a shop in Luxor in company
with several other wooden figures. The
dealer told me a long story about his
brother having died, and how he had
taken over the antiquities belonging to
him, and was selling them at a very cheap
rate. The man assured me that the statue
was a genuine antiquity, but I had my
doubts about it. Our bargaining was not
a long process, and I bought it for a small
sum. As I went out of the shop, the man
said “I hope you will have good luck with
the antīca,” which at once told me what
I had already suspected, that it was indeed
a fraud. And yet it is cleverly made. The
nose has been rubbed down to flatten it
after the manner of the ancient statues.
The back is beautifully moulded, and the
splitting of the wood very cleverly done,
but the sculptor had not taken the pains
with his work that the ancient Egyptians
were accustomed to do. The ears are badly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>shaped and the hair should have stood up
a little further from the forehead. The legs
are too short, the ancient Egyptian Statues
being remarkable for small heads, broad
shoulders, fineness
about the hips, and
long powerful limbs.
The feet are badly
moulded, and not up
to the standard of
ancient work. The
cartouche on the
base is poorly cut,
and in the inscription
on the side one
of the letters is
placed upside down.</p>

<p class='c008'>The removal of a small piece of wood
with a knife showed it to be deeply stained,

white. The most important test, however,
for wooden reproductions is the smell of the
wood.
The hawk here represented is about one
foot in height, carved out of wood and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>painted. The wings are a dull green and
the breast and back a light brown, with a
decoration upon the back. As a rule these
figures have a crown above the head, but in
this specimen it had been broken off. These
figures are frequently to be
met with in the Mousky.</p>

therefore it could not have been in use in
ancient times. The red is derived from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>the oxide of iron found in the desert.
On the front and also on the back of the
figure there is a passage from the Book of
the Dead. The modelling is good, but the
use of the Prussian blue gives it entirely
away. Nos. 2, 3, 4, and 6 represent
also the funerary figures
which used to be placed in the
tombs to do the work of the
deceased in the Underworld.
The specimens shown are made
from pieces of old mummy cases
so as to give them the appearance
of age.</p>

<p class='c008'>The plough in No. 2, <a href='#plate-05'>Plate V</a>, is a very clever imitation.
The shaft is long and exactly
proportioned, and the end takes the
form of the head of a snake. There is a
ridge a quarter of the way down the shaft,
to which was evidently attached the collar
of the oxen. The model was made, then
dipped in liquid plaster and faintly coloured
a reddish-brown. The artist made the mistake
of tying the pieces together with modern
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>string instead of using raw hide thongs as
the ancient Egyptians did. On the end
is a figure representing Min, the god of the
harvest.</p>

<p class='c008'>All the wooden figures in the illustrations
are made by the man at Gurna, who told
me with many a chuckle that he had sold
one plough for £4 to an eminent Egyptologist,
and that he had obtained £2 for another
model from the representative of a foreign
museum.</p>

<p class='c008'><a href='#plate-05'>Plate V</a>, No. 1 represents a paint-box of
the early dynasties; it is made of new wood,
covered with plaster, and coloured. On the
top of this has been applied some size, and
then some rough dirt has been thrown over
it while still wet. There is a long slit for
rush brushes, and three holes for the colouring
material, one of which contains some
colour. Its companion, No. 4, is light, and
made of old wood dipped in plaster, then
covered with size and cleverly coloured
reddish-brown in places with bars of deep
green round it. Two knobs, one for opening
the lid, and the other for holding the case,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>are to be noted. It contains four wooden
sticks for writing. There are four holes,
each containing a small amount of colouring
material.</p>

<p class='c008'>As already mentioned, there is a way of
detecting these forgeries. In addition to the
smell of the new wood there is the sour
odour of the size with which the artist
covers them before sprinkling them artistically
with various dusts. In the case of
the boxes, they are too short and the
sticks are wrong; they should have been
rushes or very thin reeds teased out at
one end and made into a brush. It was
owing to the use of these rush or reed brushes
that the letters of the ancient writings were
usually made in the same way.</p>

<p class='c008'>No. 3 of the same plate shows a reproduction
of a dove, in wood, the colouring copied
from an original.</p>

  <h2 id='ch05' class='c007'>CHAPTER V<br /> <br />STONE FIGURES</h2>
</div>
<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>One</span> day an up-river man offered for sale
some small stone figures, and told me that
he had others. I appointed a day to see
them at Ibrahim’s shop. The man, accompanied
by a friend, came in before I arrived
there, and showed them to Ibrahim, to
whom he swore by Allah that they were
genuine antiquities, and well worth buying.
Failing in his attempt to get Ibrahim to
buy them, he asked his help to persuade
me to do so, offering him a commission out
of what I should pay for them. Ibrahim,
in order to lead him on, said he would do
his best.</p>
<p class='c008'>When I arrived, a few poor specimens
of worthless antiquities were taken out of
the many receptacles which these men have
about their clothes. These were put aside
in silence, as unworthy of consideration.
Then there was a pause.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>“What else have you?” I asked.</p>

<p class='c008'>One by one the things were brought out,
until all the objects shown on <a href='#plate-05'>Plate VI</a>
were lying before us.</p>

<p class='c008'>The stone head (No. 1) is composed of
green basalt. It is supposed to represent
a royal personage, possibly Akhnaton. It
is peculiar in that the eyes show a distinct
oriental tilt. The sculpture is poor, the
ears badly made, the uræus—the sign of
royalty—is cut in, instead of being raised,
as in all the old examples of sculpture, and
the sculptor has not placed the centre of
the uræus in a line with the nose. These
are mistakes of which the ancient sculptor
would hardly have been guilty.</p>

<p class='c008'>The second head (No. 3) shows a different
tilt of the eyes. The work is by the same
man, is also in green basalt, and is no
better done.</p>

<p class='c008'>After the heads were finished they were
dipped in a kind of thin plaster, and then buried
in a manure heap, where they remained
for a time. The price asked was £1 each,
and I eventually bought them for 3<i>s.</i> each.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>No. 2 shows a bottle of steatite. This
was made in two halves, one of which broke.
The fragments were embedded in a soft
cement and moulded to correspond with
the other side, and then coloured. This
is a favourite way of faking various bowls
or bottles. I have had small granite bowls
offered to me, one part of which was whole,
but the remainder was composed of small
fragments embedded in a coloured wax, so
soft that you could indent it with your nail.
In addition to this it had the smell of wax.</p>

<p class='c008'><a href='#plate-06'>Plate VI</a>, No. 4 represents a ushebti
figure, bearing the cartouche of Thothmes III,
and a passage from the Book of the Dead. It
is composed of ordinary Nile mud, and
made in a mould. It was then taken out
and left to dry, and later on blackened over
a charcoal fire. In many of the houses in
the vicinity of Gurna and Deir-el-Bahari,
in a little hole above the door, or in some
other convenient place, these statues may
be seen, lying in their roughened condition,
just as they have been taken out of the
mould.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>The price paid for this was one piastre,
or twopence halfpenny. Many hundreds of
these figures are sold all over Egypt during
the season, and many a museum, no doubt,
considers itself enriched by the possession
of what is nothing more than a very crude
modern model of a funerary figure.</p>

<p class='c008'>No. 5 represents a woman with a wig.
She should not have been represented
carrying cylinders in her hands. The maker
has mixed two periods, the predominating
one being probably the twelfth dynasty.</p>

<p class='c008'>No. 6 is composed of serpentine, and
represents the work of about the twelfth
dynasty, and possesses the dolichocephalic
features of the skull which, according to
Elliot Smith, are characteristic of the ancient
Egyptian race. This, however, is not apparent
in the illustration. Generally speaking,
the artist has not quite conformed to the
Egyptian style. The ancient sculpture at
all periods acquired its distinctive features
from being produced in conformity with
a canon. As everything was done by
rule, there was an absolute certainty that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>each article of the period would have the
distinguishing marks of this rule upon it,
and that no stroke of the chisel, however
rough or hastily applied, would be tentative.
The effect would be produced rapidly
and surely, and the amount of labour
expended upon these statues would have
produced a greater amount of detailed
modelling.</p>

<p class='c008'><a href='#plate-06'>Plate VI</a>, No. 7, is a copy of a ushebti
of the nineteenth dynasty, made of soluble
composition, probably plaster of Paris, with a
weight inside, and representing basalt. The
materials are very fine, and hold tightly together.
It was roughly modelled first, then
trimmed and cut. The maker has observed
ancient modelling sufficiently to make the ears
large, but he has not carried his observation
to the point of studying by what
conventional strokes of the chisel the
details of the ears and the features of the
face were produced. All Egyptian features
were produced by conventional means
with hardly any variety. The tools were
held and the strokes made in the same
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>manner, or the same effect could not be
arrived at.</p>

<p class='c008'>A favourite price with these men is £40,
and this is what the man asked for the first
figure he brought out; £20 for the mummy
figure, and £10 for the other. I offered £1
for the three. On hearing this he very
scornfully packed them up again, and we proceeded
to bargain for the smaller antiquities
he had brought with him. Then the touch
of the money in his palm seemed to quicken
his desire for more. Quickly some black
beads, a forged wooden paint-pot, alabaster
pots, scarabs, and various other things
changed hands for a shilling or two each.
Then I prepared to go.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What you give for these?” demanded
his companion, indicating the figures.</p>

<p class='c008'>“They are frauds, and useless,” I replied.</p>

<p class='c008'>“But you are well known. You buy
new things.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, at a price.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“What you give then? You say something.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Eventually for £2 15<i>s.</i> I became owner
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>of the statuettes and four other things, for
which they had, in the first place, asked
nearly £100.</p>

<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c008'>A few years ago a large hotel was erected
near Cairo, and Italian workmen were
brought over to make scagliola, or imitation
stone, for pillars, &amp;c. There is no doubt
that the Egyptians seized the opportunity
to acquire further knowledge, which has
been applied to the forging of antiquities.</p>

<p class='c008'>The maker of these stone forgeries is an
up-river man with a keen, clever face. The
skin of his left hand is soft, but that of his
right hand is much harder; the fingers and
thumb of this hand are bent back, showing
that they have been used for hard pressure.
He informed me that he always copied from
a genuine antiquity or from one of the
ancient carvings upon a temple wall.</p>

<p class='c008'>A collector was approached one day by
a young man who offered some small objects
for sale. These were worthless, colourless
scarabs and sacred eyes. Some were real
enough, but broken, and of no value. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>collector bought a few, and the man hinted
at a statue, and gave certain vague particulars
about it. A time was appointed, and
in a hole in a room, which had been covered
up by boards, the statue was seen, standing
upright and at least two feet in height. It
was taken out, and the collector examined
it carefully. It seemed to be a splendid
piece of work. The features were finely
chiselled, and it was apparently the work of
one of the best periods.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Let me show it to the museum authorities,”
said the collector. But the owner
objected.</p>

<p class='c008'>“No,” he said. “They will keep it, and
send me to prison for having it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>In the end a bargain was struck for £220,
and the money paid. One day the collector
showed it to a friend, who after some time
made a remark which aroused the owner’s
suspicions. He then sought the advice of
an expert, who was extremely guarded in
expressing his opinion. After a long and
careful examination, however, he pronounced
it a forgery.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>It is only fair to say that in this instance
the money was returned. The seller was
willing to do this rather than run the risk
of a prosecution, which would give him a
bad name, and possibly a long term of
imprisonment.</p>

<p class='c008'>I saw recently a forged granite statue
which was of quite good workmanship,
and another which had a fault, in that the
face was turned ever so slightly to one side.</p>

<p class='c008'>In <a href='#plate-07'>Plate VII</a>, Nos. 1, 2, 4, 5 are supposed
to represent the sons of Horus. They are
made of bone and have some plaster sticking
on the reverse side. Badly cut, they are not
even correct in form, as the faces should
be those of a man, a dog-faced ape, a jackal,
and a hawk.</p>

<p class='c008'>No. 3 is an Osiris figure of unusual form.</p>

<p class='c008'>No. 6 shows a ram’s head in red Aswan
granite. This was the first example of
forgery in granite that I had seen. The
work is crude, and the features are not well
brought out, but it is a remarkable example
of the length to which these natives will go,
and the trouble they will take in order to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>impose upon the credulous and get money.
There is no doubt that a large number of
the Egyptians have learnt to work the
harder kinds of stone while employed in
building the Aswan Dam.</p>

<p class='c008'>No. 7 is a small stone hawk of incorrect shape.</p>

<p class='c008'>No. 8 represents a frog cut in serpentine.</p>

<p class='c008'>No. 9 is a crocodile made of slate. Part
of the tail is lacking.</p>

<p class='c008'>Nos. 10 and 11. Few people buy these
as antiquities now. Their principal use
seems to be that of paper-weights. They
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>are made of plaster of Paris, and coloured.
The price is about 1<i>s.</i> or less, but there is
no doubt that some years ago they were
freely sold as genuine antīcas.</p>

<p><span class='small'>Sandstone Tablet and kneeling figure</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>The figure on page 54 shows the statue
of a kneeling man holding a tablet. It was
said to have been taken out of a serdab, but
the inscription has no meaning. The statue
was some fifteen inches in height, and the
maker had reproduced the old colours very
cleverly.</p>

<p class='c008'>The history of this tablet is somewhat
curious. It was bought at Luxor for £50,
and brought down to Cairo, where a doubt
was cast upon its authenticity. A corner
of the tablet was cut off with a saw, and
it was found to be composed of sandstone.
Eventually the owner became convinced
that it was not a real antīca, and being unwilling
to burden his luggage with so heavy
a weight, gave it away. I found it standing
in an out-of-the-way corner, with its face
to the wall. It is an undoubted fraud.</p>

<p class='c008'>On another occasion a Jewish collector
of antiquities was approached by a Bedouin
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>who said that he had some things to sell. A
day was arranged, and they proceeded to
inspect the find. There was a large stone
statue and some small, almost worthless
articles. After long haggling, a price was
agreed upon, £75 for the lot, apportioned
in the following way. The small articles
were priced by the Bedouin at £35, £30, and
£5 respectively, leaving £5 only as the price
of the statue.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Arab seemed very stupid and it was
hard to make him understand, but eventually
the bargain was struck, and the relics were
taken to the Jew’s house. There photographs
of the statue were taken, and sent
to Paris and Berlin. After a time, the
reply came back that the statue was an
imitation.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Jew made a great outcry, but the
Bedouin, who no longer appeared stupid,
pointed out that no question had been raised
about the genuineness of the smaller objects,
nor could there be, as they were real, and that
only £5 had been paid for the statue. To
show his good faith, he would return the £5
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>and let the Jew keep the other antīcas at
the price he had paid for them, and this was
eventually accepted.</p>

</div>

<p class='c008'>Here is a curious story about another
statue. There were two very clever men
who lived in a village not far from the Great
Pyramid. Both sold antiquities, but for
some reason one was under the suspicion of
the Government Department. A beautiful
statue came into his possession, but he was
afraid to offer it for sale himself, so he
applied secretly to his <i>confrère</i> for assistance.</p>

<p class='c008'>Shortly afterwards his people called me
in to see him medically. At first sight the
case was a perplexing one. There were no
evidences of disease, and yet the man was
sunk in a profound depression; he could
not sleep, nor take any interest in the affairs
of his family. He sat, sighing and silent,
clasping and unclasping his fingers, day
after day, surrounded by his sympathising
men-friends, who smoked and drank coffee,
as their custom is. The action of the heart
got weaker and weaker, and his stomach
would not “walk well,” while he said that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>he was very tired and thought he would like
to die. One day I ordered all his friends
out of the room, and then, after rolling out
a verse of the Koran, asked him what it was
that was taking “the blood from his heart”?</p>

<p class='c008'>At first he would not answer, but after
I had pointed out to him that he was walking
with his eyes open towards the tomb, where
the angels Munker and Nakir would not be
so gentle in questioning him as I had been,
he gave way and told me the whole story.</p>

<p class='c008'>He had bought a statue from some of the
fellaheen who had dug it up out of their
fields. They had been hard to deal with,
but he had sat for days, threatening them
with the police and the wrath of the Antiquities
Department. In the end he had
bought the statue for the price of a feddan
of land. He was as innocent as milk of
doing wrong things, but some <i>kelb</i> (dog)
had told the Department of Antiquities
lies, and now he could not conduct his
business without fear. It was best to be
honest, as he had always said, but what
could one do with men whose breath poisoned
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>the air around them? Life was hard, and
only fools went out of their way to seek for
trouble. Therefore had he called in his
neighbour to assist him in disposing of his
treasure. His neighbour had taken the
statue into his house, and in a week
came an up-river man, who stayed there
for a time. After many weeks, his neighbour
had sent back a statue which was
not the original, but a good copy, made
by the man from up the river. Now,
he could not take an action in the Courts
to recover his statue, which was worth
many hundreds of pounds, and meant, as
the Pasha would understand, many acres
of land, so “it is finished.” Sorrowfully he
rocked himself to and fro in the most abject
misery as he told the tale, and looked
appealingly at me for sympathy.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was difficult to treat a man hit so hard
as this man was. It was “his chance,”
which comes only once in a lifetime, and
he had missed it. Bromides procured a
little sleep, but the patient wasted away,
and seemed not to want to live.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>Then one day came some news. His
neighbour had sold the statue to a museum
in America for a large sum. It had been
discovered to be a fraud, and had been
returned; the money had had to be refunded,
and the man had lost the cost of
making the second statue, also his good
name, and incurred sundry other expenses.</p>

<p class='c008'>When the patient heard this, his eyes
brightened forthwith. He got up from his
bed, called for water, and ordered food to
be prepared. Then he washed and prayed,
and after that he ate a hearty meal.</p>

<p class='c008'>Later I found that he had inspected his
land, ordered alterations to his house, and
given his wives extra money. I came across
him in one of his fields, and he told me
the news with many pious sayings. When
we parted he clasped my hand warmly,
saying, “Good-bye, oh Doctor Pasha.
Allah kerim [God is merciful], and we are
all his children; but, as my father said,
it is always best to be honest.”</p>

  <h2 id='ch06' class='c007'>CHAPTER VI<br /> <br />PORCELAIN FIGURES</h2>
</div>
<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>Ushebti</span> figures in blue porcelain, of varying
sizes, are now being made in Luxor, and
I believe also in the Delta, near Zagazig.
The modelling is good in some cases, and
very bad in others, but the glaze is the wrong
colour. The old Egyptian glaze was thin,
and evenly distributed, while the new glaze
is thicker in parts, patchy, and not quite
the proper blue (<i>see</i> <a href='#plate-01'>Frontispiece</a>), but these
faults will probably be rectified in a very
short time.</p>
<p class='c008'>The old Egyptian blue is commonly supposed
to have been produced by grinding
down turquoise, but there is no evidence
that the Egyptians used these stones for
such a purpose, although they mined turquoise
in Sinai from prehistoric times.</p>

<p class='c008'>Some time ago I came across a visitor
and a friend sitting examining some specimens
of Egyptian antiquities with a view
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>to purchase. The seller, an Arab, was
squatting on the ground beside a small
table, which was covered with various
objects from scarabs to small statues. Near
by were sitting two charming ladies, who
watched the proceedings with much
interest.</p>

<p class='c008'>I came up in time to hear an offer of £20
for a small, but handsome, black statue of
Isis with the infant Horus, and some blue
ushebti figures. The goddess and her son
were represented as being seated upon a
kind of throne.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You know about these things,” said
the visitor to me. “Come and tell me what
you think.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Modestly disclaiming any special knowledge,
I took a seat and examined the figures
for which I had heard the offer of £20. The
model of Isis and Horus was beautifully
cut, and appeared to be made of polished
diorite, but close examination showed that
it was composed of plaster of Paris, coloured
black, similar to the black scarab (No. 8
on <a href='#plate-08'>Plate VIII</a>). The three ushebti figures
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>were also very suspicious, for the blue was
not the right colour, and the glaze was too
uneven to be the work of the old Egyptians.
As I laid the figures down, the Arab, who
knew me well, looked straight into my face.
Not a feature moved, and his eyes were
steady and expressionless. Then, pushing
a tin box towards me, he said, “Here are
some very good scarabs. Look at them.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“What do you think of the figures?”
whispered the visitor.</p>

<p class='c008'>At that moment Providence sent a
wandering Egyptologist on the scene.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Ah, here is the man who knows,” was
my reply. By careful shepherding, the
expert was got across to the table, and
comfortably settled in a chair. I saw an
angry look come over his face when he
caught sight of the specimens, and I very
quietly withdrew. As I left I heard the
visitor say, “Ah well, you wouldn’t take
my offer of twenty pounds, and now I shall
retire from the business.”</p>

<p class='c008'>An hour later, the charming ladies who
had watched the scene fell foul of me for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>having permitted an ignorant visitor to be
robbed of twenty pounds for worthless
frauds.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why, <i>we</i> could see that they were not
genuine!” they cried.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Then why didn’t you say so?” was
my testy reply.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It was not our business; he didn’t
ask <i>us</i>,” they said scornfully. “But we
heard him ask <i>you</i>, and you did not
answer.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Now, it was quite useless to explain that
I had stopped the sale by bringing the
Egyptologist into the affair. I was put
down as “a mean thing,” and not forgiven
for some time after. Nor was this all the
misfortune that befell me, for later the
Egyptologist said huffily, “Look here, when
next your opinion is asked upon antiquities,
spurious or otherwise, do the work yourself,
and don’t bring <i>me</i> into it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Later, the visitor loftily denied that he
had offered £20 for the figures. Then it
was that the ladies partly forgave me, for
they had heard the offer made.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>Recently a bronze statue was sent from
the Oasis of Khargeh to a dealer in Cairo,
with the statement that it had just been
discovered there. The sum of £500 was
asked for it. Curiously enough, on the
dealer’s shelf stood a reproduction of that
particular statue. A comparison of the
two showed that they were identical. The
new piece was probably made by Italians
and taken to the Oasis, where it was
buried, and after a time dug up and sent
to the dealer, who blandly refused to
buy it.</p>

<p class='c008'>Khargeh is an oasis in the Libyan Desert,
lying more than one hundred miles to the
west of the Nile. In the ancient days
the Romans had an outpost there. Now
it is the scene of the labours of a land company,
and the Egyptian Government sometimes
banishes habitual criminals and bad
characters to this place.</p>

<p class='c008'>On another occasion, when I was purchasing
spurious antiquities, the seller produced
a well-made statue of Isis with the
infant Horus. It was cut in white stone, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>the work was very good. He offered it to
me for a low price, but I unfortunately tried
to beat him down. At this he took umbrage,
although he carefully concealed it from me.
When I said that I would take the statue,
he quietly pointed out to me that the price
was £6, not 6<i>s.</i> Nor would he abate one
piastre, but wrapping his statue up in some
old rags, saluted me and went away. Later
on I inquired from Ibrahim why it was
that the man had become angry; his reply
was, “These men are like that; sometimes
they will sell you a thing cheaply and
make no trouble over being beaten down;
another time they will take offence, and
though you may afterwards offer them their
own price, yet they will not sell the thing to
you, but will wrap it up and take it away.”</p>

  <h2 id='ch07' class='c007'>CHAPTER VII<br /> <br />SCARABS</h2>
</div>
<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>This</span> is, perhaps, one of the most difficult
chapters to write, for to such a pitch of
perfection have the forgers brought their
reproductions, that it is now extremely
difficult for even well-known Egyptologists
to give a definite statement concerning the
genuineness or otherwise of a specimen
submitted to them.</p>
<p class='c008'>Some years ago the authorities at the
Museum in Cairo would give their decision
regarding antiquities shown to them by visitors,
but now that is all changed, and they
refuse to express an opinion. The Egyptians,
however, still loudly protest that they
are willing to have their scarabs submitted
to the Museum authorities, knowing perfectly
well that the experts there will give
no opinion at all; but they hope that by so
frankly and freely making this offer, the
collector will take it for granted that the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>specimen is genuine, otherwise they would
not be willing to take the risk of submitting
it to such authorities.</p>

<p class='c008'>From time to time the vendors make a
<i>coup</i>, which, as there is a certain freemasonry
amongst them, becomes known, and stimulates
others to renewed efforts.</p>

<p class='c008'>The novice in antiquities is extremely
likely to be taken in, and should he show
any disposition to buy, or express a wish to
purchase, articles other than those shown to
him, by some mysterious means the news
goes round, and immediately there gather
from all parts sellers of specimens both false
and real. These men will never give each
other away, but will back up the most lying
assertions with surprising assurance mingled
with the most childlike assumption of innocence.
If found out, they will swear by
their gods that it is you who are mistaken,
not they. They will look you straight in
the face while telling you the most bare-faced
untruths. This attitude they will
carry to a great length and then suddenly
break down, grin, and admit that the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>supposed antiquity is a fraud, but will deny
any desire to cheat you. Later on they
will make a special journey to see you again,
bringing with them some more forgeries,
fondly hoping that you may be induced to
buy one of them.</p>

<p class='c008'>The scarab, or replica of the sacred beetle
of Egypt, was used as a seal, an amulet, or
a charm, and was buried with the dead in
large numbers, sometimes arranged in a
certain form upon the mummy’s chest. In
the place of the heart there is frequently to
be found a large scarab with sayings from the
Book of the Dead inscribed upon it. It was
supposed that the sacred beetle would ward
off attacks of evil spirits, and give the dead
a better chance of resting in peace in the
other world. Sometimes a scarab would
be inscribed with the records of an event,
such as a voyage to Punt. Amenhotep III,
in celebration of his marriage with Queen
Tiy, issued a large number of scarabs, carved
in stone and engraved with a record of the
event. (<i>Breasted.</i>)</p>

<p class='c008'>The forgeries of scarabs are very numerous,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>and date back to remote periods. A few
thousand years ago, it was not uncommon
for a maker of charms to forge scarabs and
amulets belonging to a king or a period
long past, and sell them as the real article,
for then, as now, the real antique had the
greater value.</p>

<p class='c008'>During the past few years, the making of
forgeries has received a great impetus owing
to the scarcity of the real articles, and the
ever-increasing demand. Many are the
humorous tales told about the difficult positions
in which experts have found themselves,
when suddenly confronted with palpable
frauds and a demand for an expression of
opinion.</p>

<p class='c008'>A story is told of an expert who wished
to play off a joke upon a very old and valued
friend. So he fashioned two scarabs, and
cut upon them the story of the circumnavigation
of Africa. There is an ancient
record that two scarabs were really in existence
bearing inscriptions concerning this
journey. It is said that Necho had them
made during his lifetime and had the record
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>of the journey cut upon them, but up to
the present they have not been found. The
expert intended to send those he had made
round to his old friend as a birthday present,
and the two would have laughed and
chuckled together over the joke. Finally
he put them away in his desk to await the
proper time to send them, and then other
matters claimed his attention so that he
forgot all about them.</p>

<p class='c008'>Some years later an illness came on, and he
died. When his effects were disposed of,
these scarabs were found and sold to a
museum for £400. After a time they were
discovered to be forgeries, and an action at
law was brought in Europe. Despite the
fact that the sellers pleaded ignorance and
good faith, one was sentenced to imprisonment,
not for fraud, but for the civil debt,
owing to inability to refund the amount.</p>

<p class='c008'>That the scarabs were imitation was first
discovered by a grammatical error in the
inscription, and this led to a closer examination
of the material used, which proved to
be lithographic stone.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>On another occasion, an excavator was
being entertained by a very rich man.
While smoking after dinner a number of
scarabs were produced, and the excavator’s
opinion was asked as to their being genuine
or not. £74 had been paid for them, and
the excavator was obviously in a dilemma,
for not one of them was genuine. He looked
at them carefully, one by one, and then
laid them down, saying that he would not
like to express an opinion.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Come,” urged his host, “tell me what
you think. I know you are an expert, and
I want your opinion on them.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, if you really want to know, they
are all forgeries,” said the expert grimly.</p>

<p class='c008'>There was silence for a moment, and the
host looked ruefully at the row of sacred
beetles. Then, being a good sportsman,
he said, “Don’t say a word to the ladies.
We will keep it to ourselves.”</p>

<div class='ic001'>
<p><span class='small'>SCARABS AND AMULETS.</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>That gives the essence of the whole thing.
The intrinsic value of a scarab is, perhaps,
sixpence; the archæological value is whatever
one likes to put upon them. And so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>cleverly are the forgeries made that people
are just as happy with the imitations as
they would be with the real articles, provided,
of course, that they remain in blissful
ignorance of the truth.</p>

<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c008'>One day, a big hand was laid upon my
shoulder, and a broad American voice
chuckled in my ear, “Hello, Doc, fancy
meeting you here.” He was an old friend, and
the meeting was a pleasant one. In answer
to the question how he had come there, so
far from his beloved New York, he answered:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Wal, I just sort of blew in, wanted a
change, and Wall Street not being what
I call a business proposition at this moment,
I thought I’d come. And now I’ll just go
up the Pyramid.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Later on he came back with a chastened
mien.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, how did you get on?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why, it was fine. The view ain’t exactly
like the Rocky Mountains scenery, but it
was fine all the same. And I bought some
sca-rabs.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>“You didn’t! Let me see them.”</p>

<p class='c008'>As he fumbled about for three miserable
little specimens, he explained how it came
about.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You know that place, half-way up,
where the stones jut out? Wal, when we
got there, them durned A-rabs stopped and
said, ‘Say, mister, this is the place where
they buy sca-rabs.’ I looked down, and
saw that it was a two hundred feet clean
drop to the bottom, and I said that I thought
it was, so I bought them.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“How much did you pay for them?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Two dollars.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Let me see them.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Then he produced his scarabs.</p>

<p class='c008'>“They are forgeries,” was my remark.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That may be,” said my friend complacently,
“but it was a clean drop to the
bottom from that durned stone, and I guess
I am not hankering after eternal glory just
now.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Among the scarabs was one with the name
of Khaf-Ra, the builder of the Second
Pyramid (<a href='#plate-08'>Plate VIII</a>, No. 30) upon it. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>workmanship is quite modern, and up to the
present no contemporary scarabs have been
found bearing Khaf-Ra’s name. However,
as he had only paid 8<i>s.</i> for them, he had not
been very badly done.</p>

<p class='c008'>A very large number of scarabs have been
found which are made of composition
material, or cut out of a piece of stone and
left uncoloured. These fetch very small
prices, although they may be the genuine
articles, therefore the up-river men have
taken to re-glazing them. They obtain
pieces of old glaze from the ushebti figures
and pieces of old glass and melt these down.
But the re-glazed scarabs can usually be
detected, even although the colour may be
correct, by the irregularity of the glazing,
and the fact that between the legs of the
beetle the dirt can usually be seen under
the glaze.</p>

<p class='c008'>Sometimes the makers grind up these
poor and broken scarabs and remould them.
Then they re-glaze them, and swear to you
by Allah that they are indeed old.</p>

<p class='c008'>The natives oil antiquities to make them
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>look polished or to enhance the colour.
This method the forgers are applying now
to their productions.</p>

<p class='c008'>There is a man at Qus who is a most
clever forger of gold jewellery, but he also
does a good deal of work recutting scarabs.
His procedure is to grind the inscription off
the base of the original scarab, recut the
cartouche, and re-glaze it. The scarabs can
be detected by the thinness of the base
plate, and by the peculiar manner in which
the hawks are made, with a hump on the
back, like the <i>Mut</i> vulture.</p>

<p class='c008'>Most of the spurious scarabs were, until
a year or two ago, made at Luxor, where
one man in particular is an artist at the
work. I have known him ask 8<i>s.</i> for one
which he had just finished, and obstinately
refuse to take less. “I am not like the
fellaheen, who work for five piastres a
day,” he declared. “I do good work, and
am going to be paid for it.” He did not
see any harm in what he was doing, nor
did he try to keep his business secret, and
he took a pride in turning out work
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>which was very difficult to tell from the
original.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is curious in what out-of-the-way places
these scarabs turn up. Recently, in a consulting-room
in Harley Street, one was put
before me and my opinion asked. It had
been given to the physician by a grateful
patient. I did not answer, but after a
good look laid it down. “I thought so,”
said the doctor quietly, as he picked it up
and slipped it into a drawer.</p>

<p class='c008'>One of the most remarkable features of
scarab buying is the number of people who
will avoid respectable shops where the proprietors
have a reputation to lose, on the
score that they are too dear, and then pick
up with some boy in the street who has a
glib tongue and a plausible manner, and
who brings out the inevitable tin box with
a motley assortment of worthless odds and
ends. Once let such a boy get an inkling of
the fact that you mean to buy, and he will
be back next day with a fresh lot of good-looking
antīcas. Where they come from
is a mystery, but I suspect that there is a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>system of interchange between these men,
and that they sell for one another and settle
up afterwards.</p>

<p class='c008'>I remember a lady who scornfully declined
to buy from a respectable shop, and then
found a boy who told her a long story of how
he dug antīcas up and sold them cheaper
than other people. I know that she bought
nearly £50 worth from him, but how much
more I never heard. Later on, the buyer
will to a certainty get a rude shock over
some of her cherished possessions.</p>

<p class='c008'>Amulets, or wishing scarabs, are frequently
to be bought. The frauds can, as a rule,
be told by their light weight and velvety
feel, and by the crudeness of the work;
but this last is not invariable, and every
year the scarab forgers are producing a
better article.</p>

<p class='c008'>Walking along the river-front at Luxor
one day, I was accosted by an old man who
produced a rag in which was tied up a piece
of old broken pottery. This was the lure, for
upon my refusing to buy it, he took out a
small object rolled up in pink paper. This
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>turned out to be a fine specimen of a walking
scarab. The colour was good, and the inscriptions
were very fair, while the undercutting
was extremely good.</p>

<p class='c008'>But somehow I do not like antiquities
which are taken out of a piece of pink paper,
and I refused it. A German who had been
for many years in the country came along
and snapped it up. Later on he informed
me that he had paid only one and a half
dollars for it, and that it was worth £4 or £5.
For a long time he held forth upon its
beauties and its wonderful cutting, declaring
that he had not seen so fine a specimen for
years. I had another good look at it, and
saw plainly enough that it was an imitation,
so I left him to enjoy his purchase.</p>

<p class='c008'>It must be clearly understood that the
majority of the vendors of scarabs are far
better judges of their value than any ordinary
collector, and therefore a man, even
though he be only an old and dirty individual,
would be most unlikely to sell for
a dollar and a half a scarab which was worth
£4 or £5; and the natives usually take their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>finds first of all to dealers, who would certainly
not let a good scarab pass them.</p>

<p class='c008'>European makers have now entered the
arena, and are competing with the natives
as makers of antiquities, but so far the latter
have had the best of it. The group of
scarabs numbered 1 to 5, <a href='#plate-08'>Plate VIII</a>, are
either German or Italian work. They are
very good indeed, perhaps too good. I had
to pay 18<i>s.</i> for those specimens, nor could
Ibrahim get them for me any cheaper.
But I have always felt that I was done.</p>

<p class='c008'>Some weeks after the man from whom
these were purchased came again with some
more. I was busy and Ibrahim was away,
so the matter was placed in the hands of his
son, who was instructed to obtain some for
my collection if possible. Later he handed
me four, and on looking them over, I saw to
my astonishment that one was real. I asked
how this had happened.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes,” replied the youngster, “when
I had picked out these four the man objected,
and said that one was real. I looked at
it with my father’s glass, and then offered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>to bet him a sovereign that it was not. He
then said that he did not know that I
understood scarabs so well, and let me have
the four for 8<i>s.</i>” Later Ibrahim examined
the scarab. “Yes,” he said, “the scarab
is genuine, and bears the name of Khonsu.
It is worth at least £2. My son has done
well. Now we are even, for the man charged
too much for the other five; but my son
must never offer to bet again, as he might
lose my money.”</p>

<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c008'>Once, when in a great hurry, I was stopped
by a young lady, who produced what looked
like a damaged scarab, on which she asked
my opinion. The light was very bad, and
I had no time to spare, so I gave but a
glance at the thing. She told me that she
had found it at Abou Roash Pyramid. I
wanted to be polite, and said that I thought
it was a real scarab, but that it had by some
chance been in the fire. She thanked me,
and I hurried away. At dinner that night
she told the story to a large and appreciative
table, and handed the specimen round for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>the guests to see. She had made the thing
with a penknife out of a piece of soft rock,
and had coloured it with paint. I must
admit that, when seen in a good light, the
work was very rough, and that I ought not
to have been taken in; but let any one
who thinks himself wiser be placed under
similar circumstances and see what happens.
I have found, too, that the female sex is very
apt to lay traps for the unwary male, whenever
he affects, rightly or wrongly, to possess a
superior knowledge upon any subject.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mr. Weigall, the author of “Life and
Times of Akhnaton,” told me that one
day a lady showed him a scarab which she
said she had bought from a little boy, who
told her that he had stolen it from Weigall’s
excavations. She finished up her story by
saying, “And I am sure it must be true,
for he had such an honest little face.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Here is another scarab story. A friend
was once in the Khan Khaleel bazaar in
Cairo, and was approached by a young man
in native dress who offered for sale a handful
of scarabs. My friend, who is an expert and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>very well known, was considerably astonished
at the man’s impudence, for they were
the common green scarabs made in great
quantities at the present day to sell to the
native women, and these are now being
exported even as far as the Sudan. After
a few pointed remarks, it seemed that the
man was acting in good faith. He was very
much taken aback by my friend’s ridicule,
and immediately ran off to a native who was
dressed in European clothes and seated outside
a shop about fifty paces away. A
violent quarrel was started, the end of which
my friend did not wait to see, but it was
quite clear that the scarabs had been sold by
the shopkeeper under some sort of guarantee
that they were genuine antiquities.</p>

<p class='c008'>In some cases scarabs are brought straight
from the manufactory and placed upon the
market. In other cases they are buried
in dung-heaps to give them the odour of
antiquity, then taken out, oiled and rubbed
with dirt, which makes them look old and
worn. Then the man will carry them about
with him for a considerable time, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>eventually they are ready to be offered to
the unwary collector. To my own personal
knowledge, experienced dealers in antiquities
are being taken in frequently by these modern
forgeries.</p>

<p class='c008'>The following are a few of the defects
which are to be noted in some of the specimens
illustrated on <a href='#plate-08'>Plate VIII</a>.</p>

<p class='c008'>The first five scarabs are of a turquoise
blue colour, made of china, and most probably
of European manufacture. The modelling
is good, but the colour is unusual and
too glossy.</p>

<p class='c008'>No. 1 has a wish, “May you live for ever,”
cut upon its base.</p>

<p class='c008'>No. 2 has a cartouche of Thothmes III.
upon it.</p>

<p class='c008'>No. 3 is very well cut. The inscription
is a little uneven, but the only sign of imitation
is that the glazing is too bright.</p>

<p class='c008'>No. 4 has also the cartouche of Thothmes
III. upon it, but is badly cut.</p>

<p class='c008'>In No. 5 the pro-thorax of the beetle is
out of proportion.</p>

<p class='c008'>No. 6 is a small and very well-shaped
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>scarab of a beautiful colour. The modelling
is very good, and the maker has imitated
the wear upon the old scarabs exceedingly
well. He has run a very fine line of glaze
between the wings and the thorax, but the
features of the head are indicated by marks
and not by cuttings. This is only to be
seen with a magnifying glass. The above
was bought for three piastres, but represents
one of the most beautiful forged scarabs I
have ever seen.</p>

<p class='c008'>No. 7 is of good colour, but badly shaped.
The inscription is fairly well cut, except that
the serpents come out from the bottom of
the cartouche instead of from the side, and
the name of Thothmes III. is not clearly cut.</p>

<p class='c008'>No. 8. This scarab is made of soft white
composition, and painted black. The inscription,
Ra-Men-Kheper, is beautifully cut,
but unfortunately this does not show well in
the illustration. The making of forged black
scarabs is a new departure which has been
seen for the first time this year. The price
paid was 2<i>s.</i></p>

<p class='c008'>No. 9. The cutting and shape are not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>good. The lines on the back of the beetle
are uneven, and the inscription is wrong.
It is supposed to be “Horus of Lower
Egypt,” but the lotus is cut wrongly and
should be more pointed at the bottom of
the flower.</p>

<p class='c008'>No. 10 is a scarab made from an old
amethyst bead. The hole for the thread is
from side to side, whereas in an old scarab
it is from before backwards. There is no
inscription on the base.</p>

<p class='c008'>No. 11 is bad in every way—too thick
and uneven in make, and the inscription has
no meaning.</p>

<p class='c008'>No. 12. The colour is too dark. The
letters in the inscription are poorly made,
but mean “Life and Truth for ever.” The
hole through the scarab is too narrow. The
Egyptians did not possess a straight drill,
therefore the holes made by them are
slightly larger at one end than at the other.</p>

<p class='c008'>No. 13 is an amulet, and supposed to be
of the time of Usertsen in the twelfth
dynasty. The name is correctly written,
but the letters are not well cut.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>No. 14. This might be Rameses II.,
but it is not correctly cut. Both these
amulets are of very soft composition, and
for this reason can be easily recognised as
imitations.</p>

<p class='c008'>No. 15. In this case the inscription is
incorrect and uneven.</p>

<p class='c008'>Nos. 16, 17, 18 are made of carnelian,
and are very poor, both as regards cutting
and shape. They have no inscription.</p>

<p class='c008'>No. 19. This is not the conventional
way of making scarabs. The legs are too
pronounced. The letters of the cartouche
are badly cut, and the line across the bottom
of the cartouche is too low down. The
inscription on the base is meaningless, and
the glazing is obviously new.</p>

<p class='c008'>No. 20. The hare is badly cut and proportioned.
The inscription is uneven.</p>

<p class='c008'>No. 21. This is a beautifully-cut double
scarab of very unusual form. I bought it
from a boy in the streets of Cairo for three
piastres. It is extremely well moulded, and
the colour is very good. It had been oiled,
and had what looked like ancient dirt on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>its back. Upon rubbing this dirt I found
a speck of gold underneath. For some time
opinions differed as to whether this was a
genuine scarab which had been stolen and
sold by a man who did not know its real
value, or whether it was a very clever
imitation. Examination of the base showed
that there were two inscriptions, divided in
half by an ankh (key of life). But one sign
was upside down, and some of the symbols
are longer and larger than those on the
corresponding side. The front legs are too
broad, and quite standing up. It must
have been a very difficult matter for the
imitator to produce this unusual specimen.</p>

<p class='c008'>No. 22. This represents a frog, and is
very poor work. It is made of composition,
is insufficiently glazed, and the shape is
bad.</p>

<p class='c008'>No. 23. This was meant for a goat, and
bears three cartouches on its back. The
inscriptions are incorrectly cut. The features
are absent, and the glaze has been put on
after the break across the back was done.</p>

<p class='c008'>No. 24. This is unevenly glazed, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>the inscription is incorrect and uneven;
but the beetle is well shaped.</p>

<p class='c008'>No. 25 is of good colour and shape, but
rather thick. The inscription is of the
time of Thothmes III., but the cartouche
is unfinished, the serpents being only on
one side of it, whereas they should be on
both.</p>

<p class='c008'>No. 26 is too thick, of a bad shape, and
the cutting is poor. It is supposed to
represent Horus.</p>

<p class='c008'>No. 27 is of good colour, but the inscription
is unevenly cut. It is supposed to represent
Hathor, the goddess of beauty, love, and
joy.</p>

<p class='c008'>No. 28. This is made of old scarabs,
which have been ground down and re-cast.
For this reason the seller was able to swear
the most sacred oath that it was real antīca.
The cutting of the letters is too shallow.</p>

<p class='c008'>No. 29 is well cut, a good blue, supposed
to be Amenhotep, but the letters are not
in proper order, and are meaningless.</p>

<p class='c008'>No. 30. This scarab bears the name of
Khaf-Ra, and the story about it has been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>told on pages 73 and 74. It is made of
composition, and the glaze is thick on one
side and has not adhered properly to the
other; but the scarab is well made.</p>

<p class='c008'>No. 31 is a good colour, is made of
stone, fairly cut, but the inscription has no
meaning.</p>

<p class='c008'>No. 32. This scarab bears the name of
Rameses III. and has the inscription “The
Governor of On” upon its base. The cutting
is partly in high and partly in low relief.
It is made of pottery and not quite correct
in colour.</p>

<p class='c008'>No. 33 is poor in make and cutting.</p>

<p class='c008'>No. 34 is made of soft stone, fairly cut,
but too pointed in shape. The inscription
is not well done.</p>

<p class='c008'>No. 35 is a bad colour, being a pale blue.
The head is too large for a real beetle, and
too flat; the legs too thick. The inscription
is not cut evenly, and does not mean anything.</p>

<p class='c008'>No. 36 is a very good colour. The burnt
mark on the head was caused in the firing.
The cartouche is cut too low down.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>No. 37. A large stone scarab bearing

<p class='c008'>Some years ago, when crossing the Kasr-el-Nil
bridge, a youth of the fellaheen class
edged up to me and asked if I would purchase
some seals. He said, “I have some very
good ones.” I asked to see them and he
produced one. I knew very little about
seals, but thought there was no harm in
buying a few. In the end I spent 8<i>s.</i> upon
them, and when I got home examined them
carefully. Apparently some of them were
made of carnelian and had the characteristic
marks of the stone, though they were considerably
weathered.</p>

<p class='c008'>One does not show antiquities in the
frank manner that is common to other
hobbies, so I put one in my pocket, and
placed the others away in a safe drawer.
Some days went past, and then my opportunity
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>came. I was in the shop of a dealer
noted for his keenness in detecting frauds,
and after discussing various objects with
him, I said, “Oh, I came across a seal the
other day. Just look at it, will you?”
and I casually passed it over the counter to
him. He examined it carefully, and then
a grim smile overspread his face. “How
much did you pay for it?” “I paid 8<i>s.</i>
for a lot,” I replied. “Oh, well then, you
need not grumble, for they did me out of
as many pounds as you paid shillings,”
said the dealer. The seals were imitation,
very cleverly made of glass, and rubbed
with sand to produce the appearance of age.</p>
<h3 class='c015'><span class='sc'>Ancient Pigments</span></h3>
<p class='c014'>Ancient pigments always show at some
part the unfaded colour. There is no such
thing as uniform degradation of colour.
There should be no general appearance of
decay. The ancient things were made of
fresh material, and were preserved carefully.</p>

<p class='c008'>Egyptian blue is composed of sand, copper
oxide, and soda, mixed together, ground
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>finely, then moistened with water, tied up
in a tiny bag the size of a walnut, put into
a furnace and heated to the temperature
of red-hot copper. This must be done in
a small furnace, and the temperature must
not be carried too high, or an ordinary green
glass will result. The temperature must
be just enough to fuse the copper, soda,
and silica into what is called a frit, that is,
the stage which immediately precedes the
fusion of the ingredients which would result
in glass. The ball of frit is taken out and
pulverised, mixed with glue or gum arabic,
and used as a paint. The depth of colour
decreases if the paint is ground too
finely.</p>

<p class='c008'>The green colour is either the natural
green ore (malachite), or an oxide or artificial

<p class='c008'>The purple colour is manganese oxide.</p>

<p class='c008'>The red colour is simply earthy hæmatite

</div>
<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>Alabaster</span> jars were used in the old
days to contain pigments, ointment, kohl,
and similar commodities. They were also
placed in large numbers in the graves,
hence the quantity that comes into the
market. The price is moderate, from a few
shillings to several pounds, and one would
hardly have thought it worth while for the
forgers to copy them; yet it is now regularly
done. But there is something about
the old alabaster jar or pot which makes it
somewhat easier to distinguish from forgeries
than is the case with scarabs. In the
old pots there are certain irregularities of
make, a kind of lumpiness from the way in
which they were cut out. The pots are thin
and drilled out to the bottom with the bow-drill,
and the outsides are worn. Forgeries
are made on the lathe, and are turned out
regular in shape. They are thicker, heavier,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>and not drilled down to the bottom. The
work on the interior is rough, and gives
signs of having been hastily done. Some
of the smaller pots are made in two halves,
an upper and a lower, and joined by a cement
about the middle. Sometimes old pots are
recut or re-shaped, in order to give them a
better appearance. The ones most difficult
to tell from the originals are those made
with the old bow-drill, for here comes in
the slight irregularity of shape, and the
work approaches much more nearly to that
of the ancient Egyptians, as it is most
probable that the originals were made in
the same way.</p>

<p class='c008'><a href='#plate-09'>Plate IX</a> shows various kinds of alabaster
pots, all of which are forgeries. Of recent
years, a demand has arisen for heads carved
out of alabaster. As it is quite certain
that the value of these would be considerable,
were they genuine antīcas, and the
supply would be extremely small, the
Egyptian has stepped in, and is endeavouring
to supply the want after his fashion.
Fig. 2 shows a head in alabaster. The style
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>is of the Greek period. The workmanship
is only fair, and carelessly done, the ears
not having been formed at all. However,
it represents a period when Egyptian Art
was declining.</p>

<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c008'>I remember an up-river man, who was
employed on an excavation, picking up a
piece of stone, and in his spare time fashioning
a head out of it with his knife. Later
on he showed it to his employer. The
excavator looked at it grimly for a few
moments. Then, remarking that the man
was far too clever to be a simple workman
on a digging, he discharged him and sent
him back to his village.</p>

<p class='c008'>A few years ago some life-sized alabaster
statues of Mykerinos, the builder of the
Third Pyramid, were found by the Harvard
University Expedition. They had been
considerably mutilated, but some of them
were put together, and fortunately the heads
were but little damaged. The statues
showed three periods in the life of Mykerinos:
youth, early manhood, and then a rather
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>later period. The workmanship was exquisite,
and the value of the statues was
enormous.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is safe to say that this discovery has
not been lost sight of by the spurious
antiquity makers, as alabaster is a soft
stone to work in, and offers a fair scope for
the exhibition of their talent. I have
already been shown a very rough copy
in alabaster of what one of these spurious
antiquity makers called the features of
Mykerinos. Fortunately they presented no
resemblance, a fact which I did not impart
to him.</p>

</div>
<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>On</span> the way to Deir-el-Bahari, a man offered
to sell me the small blue vase with a handle
shown in <a href='#plate-10'>Plate X</a>. He asked 25<i>s.</i> for it,
but a glance served to show that it was not
genuine; the colour was too blue, and the
weight of it showed that it was solid, not
hollow. This was confirmed by testing it
with a hatpin belonging to one of our party,
and I proceeded to bargain. Eventually
I bought it for 5<i>s.</i> On leaving Deir-el-Bahari,
a youth accosted me and offered
another small vase, similar to the first one.
This I bought for 3<i>s.</i>, wrapped it up carefully,
placed it in my pocket, and a moment
later bent over my saddle and smashed it.
However, the first one was safe.</p>
<p class='c008'>On my return to Luxor I found in an
antiquity shop a whole string of them at
2<i>s.</i> each, the proprietor being open to a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>deal. They are made of soft material, <i>gir</i>,
a kind of native mortar, and will stand
very little rough usage.</p>

<p class='c008'>Most of the porcelain objects are supposed
to date from the eighteenth dynasty, but
up to the present I have not seen in any
museum a genuine antiquity similar to the
small blue vase. The possibility is that
the Arabs may have one, which they are
using as a pattern in the manufacture, or
this style might even be a creation of their
own.</p>

<p class='c008'>On the same <a href='#plate-10'>Plate</a> is a bottle (No. 1),
with two handles, and two monkeys sitting
on each side of the neck, also made of
porcelain; but it has a thick glaze over it,
and has been buried for some time in a heap
of manure taken from the courtyard of the
house, which was fresh enough for active
chemical action to take place, and the effect
of this is well shown on the bottle.</p>

<p class='c008'>Nos. 3, 7, and 8 are of the same period, and
have a peculiarity common to the previous
one also—namely, they are all extremely light
in weight, and are made by the same maker.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>No. 2 is a jar with a handle, made of
wood and painted. It is partly hollowed
out, and the wood is new.</p>

<p class='c008'>The blue bowl (<a href='#plate-10'>Plate X</a>, No. 5) is very pretty.
It was not made on
a wheel, but modelled
first and then glazed.
The material is a soft
brownish gir, or lime
mixed with very fine
sand. These bowls
are very fragile, and
are held together by
the glaze.</p>

head, represented in the above line engraving,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>were, after prolonged bargaining, bought for
7<i>s.</i> and 6<i>s.</i> each. The seller, an up-river
man, took a most solemn oath that they were
old, but that the glaze was new. When I
pinned him down to definite statements,
he explained to me that he meant that the
earth of which they were composed was
old; which of course is true, but that is
not the sense in which the ordinary buyer
would understand it. With this reservation
he would feel himself at liberty to take
the most solemn oaths that, with the exception
of the glaze, his specimens were
really old.</p>

<p class='c008'>As I have said, the forgers are now also in
the habit of melting the old glass fragments
and pieces of glaze, and using it to recolour
their productions.</p>

<p class='c008'>In some of the antiquity shops in Luxor
there may be seen cases containing admitted
imitations of ancient pottery ware. The
prices asked for these imitations are from
£l 10<i>s.</i> to £3 each. When I pointed out
to the dealer that this was a stiff price to
pay for what was an admitted forgery, he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>indignantly denied any intention of fraud,
and declared that these objects were artistic
in design and execution, and well worth the
money he asked for them. One cannot
help feeling, however, that should an unwary
tourist or an ignorant collector arrive on
the scene, it is possible that he might become
the possessor of one of these porcelain objects
without having any idea that it was not a
genuine antiquity.</p>

however, gives the effect of age. It is
beautifully coloured, and the date is about
the eighteenth dynasty. By the side of it
is a lotus bowl (No. 1) made by the same
maker. These are really charming objects
of interest, and are very cleverly made; the

sums of money were asked for them, but
they were purchased for a few shillings each
at the end of the season, when the up-river
men were anxious to go home to their villages,
and did not want to take back any unsold

<p class='c008'>No. 12. This small bottle can hardly
be called a forgery, and is well described
by Wilkinson, who says:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Years ago some small bottles, having
upon them Chinese inscriptions, were found
in some tombs. These were held to establish
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>a link between China and the ancient
Egyptians. It is now known, however, that
these bottles are of a comparatively recent
period. M. Prisse discovered, by dint of
questioning the Arabs of Cairo who were
engaged in selling objects of antiquity, that
the bottles were never found in tombs, and
that the greater part of them came from
Tous, Keft, and Kosseir, depôts of commerce
with India on the Red Sea. The quality
of these bottles is very inferior, and they
appear to have been made before the manufacture
of porcelain had attained the same
degree of perfection in China as in after

<p class='c008'>Two years ago I saw four granite bowls
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>in a shop at Luxor. They were magnificent
specimens, large and beautifully made, and
seemed indeed objects to be coveted. The
price asked was £250
each, or £1000 for the
four. At first I looked
at them with awe and
admiration, but on
making a careful examination,
I found
that they showed
none of the small
irregularities which
are found on the old
work, and that their
edges were too clean cut. It seemed as if
they must have been made, buried, and
forgotten at once, as there were no signs of
wear upon them. While handling them I
felt sure that they were not genuine, but
the work of some very clever sculptor,
perhaps an Italian, for many of the latter
were employed in working granite at the
barrage at Aswan, and they are adepts
in the art of working the harder stones.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>Last year I was again in Luxor, and,
possessing somewhat more knowledge of antiquities,
I called upon the dealer and asked
to see the bowls again. He had sold them,
but he told me, in a deprecating manner,
clasping and unclasping his hands as though
the luck had been too great and undeserved,
that he had been fortunate enough to get
three more, just like them. These he produced,
and beautiful specimens indeed they
were, but without committing myself too
definitely, I should question very much
their genuineness. But this man will sell
them, as he sold the other four. Some one
will buy them and take them to America
or England, or some other country, and
after a time they will, perhaps, find their
way to a museum, where there will be
whispered consultations amongst the experts,
and queries as to the wisdom of looking a
gift horse in the mouth.</p>

<p class='c008'>Or it may be that they will adorn a
private collection, in which case, sooner or
later, some unfortunate Egyptologist will be
brought face to face with them, and will
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>have to make his escape the best way he
can.</p>

<p class='c008'>Think of what it means to this man at
Luxor. Out of these seven bowls, he may
make, allowing for the cost of producing
them, about £1600 profit. He can buy
about twelve acres of ground, perhaps more,
for this sum. If he farms it himself, he
may make as much as £300 a year from this.
If he lets it out, preferring to sit in idleness
and play the part of a big man, he will find
his income increased by about £120 a year
through this little transaction. This means
that he is a comparatively rich man.</p>

</div>

<p class='c008'>Granite bowls offered for sale by vendors
of antiquities are frequently made up of
fragments. Perhaps, when the bowl was
discovered, a third part of it may have been
missing, but a few bits were found from time
to time, and these were carefully preserved
and put away. On turning over heaps of
debris, more bits are found, and when there
are sufficient pieces the missing part of the
bowl is made up of composition or wax, and
the fragments stuck in in such a way as to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>reproduce the characteristics of the stone.
Then the whole is carefully rubbed with
dirt, and set to harden. Later on, a tourist
pays £10 or £20 for that which is in part
a real antiquity, but in part is only composition.</p>

<p class='c008'>I remember seeing in a museum two
bowls which had fallen to pieces since
they had been placed in the case. It was
supposed that the influence of the air had
caused them to crumble away, but this was
not so. They had been made up with wax.
The museum authorities had bought them
from a dealer, and for years they had stood
in the case. Then the wax gave way, and
they fell to pieces. Examination with a
glass showed mould on the wax.</p>

<p class='c008'>I have repeatedly been offered similar
bowls, and at first I found it difficult to tell
which was the made-up part. One way
is to engage the seller’s attention with something
else, and then scratch the suspected
part with the finger nail, or some other
suitable instrument. It is quite certain
that the finger nail will not make an impression
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>on granite, so that, if an indentation
or a scratch appears, you may be sure that
the bowl is made up; but if the material
used to make up the bowl is scagliola, it
becomes more difficult to tell, and you may
require the aid of a powerful magnifying
glass before the fraud can be detected.</p>

  <h2 id='ch10' class='c007'>CHAPTER X<br /> <br />MUMMIES AND MUMMY CASES</h2>
</div>
<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>It</span> may be thought hardly possible that the
makers of spurious antiquities could copy
the mummies and their cases. And yet
there is no doubt that this has been done.
In the tale told by Dr. G. A. Reisner in
the next chapter, he mentions that in a tomb
which had been “faked up,” there were
coffins and other objects.</p>
<p class='c008'>Recently a gentleman became possessed
with the idea of obtaining a mummy in its
case. He spoke of this openly, and on
several occasions was warned to be careful,
or he would be imposed upon. People
rarely thank one, however, for such advice,
preferring to believe the smiling, plausible,
ready-tongued dragoman or dealer, with
whom they are in negotiation. Indeed, sometimes
advice given under these circumstances
tends to bring about a certain coolness,
and the expert may have reason to regret,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>by the loss of cordial relations, that he had
ever attempted to save his friend from an
act of folly. The gentleman in question
desired to present to his native town a
mummy in its case, and, though warned,
persisted in carrying on the negotiations.
Eventually a handsome case, containing
what appeared to be a genuine mummy,
was submitted to him. The price finally
agreed upon was £200. A little later, an
Egyptologist saw the case, and without
hesitation pronounced it to be a forgery.</p>

<p class='c008'>The man who sold me the wooden figures
seen in <a href='#plate-03'>Plate III</a>, told me with great glee
that he had made mummy cases from bits
of old mummy cases and other wood.
One he sold to an American for £4, and
when, later on, this American showed it
to the authorities of a museum, he was at
once offered £12 for it. However, he was so
pleased with his bargain that he refused
the offer.</p>

<p class='c008'><a href='#plate-14'>Plate XIV</a> shows a piece of new wood
made up to represent a piece of genuine
mummy case.</p>
<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>
  <h3 class='c015'><span class='large'><span class='sc'>Mummy Cloth</span></span></h3>
</div>
<p class='c014'>The mummy cloth of ancient times was
made with the warp and woof of different
thicknesses—the warp being thicker than
the woof, so that it would hang and fold
better. The piece of mummy cloth shown
in <a href='#plate-15'>Plate XV</a>, No. 3 is genuine, but the
painting on it has been done recently, as
one may be pretty sure from several signs.
The painting has been put on with a brush,
instead of having the design outlined with
a reed and then painted. The colour has
run, and shows beyond the edge of the
design; and the cloth, being dirty, shows
signs of where the paint has wetted it. It
may belong to the twenty-second dynasty.</p>

<p class='c008'>In ancient days the workmanship, however
bad or however hastily executed, was
always done according to fixed rules, and
each line had its meaning.</p>

<p class='c008'>This year, for the first time, I have seen
copies of the long beads for which Egypt
is so famous. These are probably made
in Venice. The colour is beautiful, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>mixed with the imitations are a few really
old beads. The material used is glass, and
can be easily broken between the fingers.
The mode of selling these spurious beads is
to have them made up in a pattern, and to
have genuine beads made up with them.
They are manufactured in various colours,
but ladies especially admire the blue beads,
and the men sell six of the blue colour to one
of the other. I bought three lots, made up as
seen in the illustration, <a href='#plate-15'>Plate XV</a>, No. 2. Two
were genuine, but the blue one was false. The
price I paid was 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> each, and the seller
looked at me ruefully, and said, “You have got
three pounds’ worth of beads there.” In the
case of the forged blue beads the colour is
equal all the way round. The old beads are
made of a kind of composition; they are
thicker, less regular, and there is usually
one part upon which the colour has failed
to be equal—that is the side upon which
the beads were laid when fired.</p>

<p class='c008'>No. 1 shows some glass beads supposed to
be Roman, but they were made recently in
Venice.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>No. 4 is a string of imitation sacred cats
with genuine old beads, used as a necklace.</p>

<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c008'>There is a beautiful story, the humour
of which would be spoilt by too searching
an inquiry into its authenticity, about what
is jokingly called “the predynastic mummy.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The tale opens about the time when the
predynastic graves were found in Nubia.
There was a great rush on the part of museums
all over the world to acquire specimens. It
will probably be remembered that the bodies
were placed in the graves lying upon one side,
the legs drawn up, and one hand placed
before the face. They were unembalmed,
but the dryness of the climate had given the
skin the appearance of light-coloured leather.
Around the body were placed a number of
jars and rough vessels. As the demand
increased, prices rapidly rose. The Arabs
vied with a Coptic antiquity dealer in finding
and selling the graves, which were then
taken whole to the museums. After a
time the supply ran short, and the demand
became urgent. The natives were hard put
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>to it, but with their customary adaptability,
they rose to the occasion; and it is said that
they killed their business opponent, the
Coptic dealer, and buried his body in the
approved position. Under the peculiar
climatic conditions obtaining in Nubia, a
body often dries before decomposition can
take place, so, some time later on, when a
special request came from an important
museum for a specimen of the predynastic
burials, they “discovered” the grave in
which they had buried their opponent, and
sold the whole thing, pots and all, to the
museum. But they could not keep their
good fortune to themselves, and later on
were heard in the village to boast that they
had sold old Aboutig for £450.</p>

<p class='c008'>The above story is almost too good to
spoil, but what really happened, I believe,
was that, when the supply of predynastic
burials fell short, the natives took a body
from a neighbouring cemetery and arranged
it in one of the predynastic graves which
was minus a body, and later sold the lot.</p>

  <h2 id='ch11' class='c007'>CHAPTER XI<br /> <br />A FORGED TOMB</h2>
</div>
<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>I am</span> indebted to Dr. G. A. Reisner for the
following story and incidents, and for others
which are incorporated in the earlier chapters
of this book.</p>
<p class='c008'>“It was in the summer of 1902, I think, that
a couple of young men from the west bank
of the Nile at Thebes visited a dealer in
antiquities whose shop is in Luxor. After
general conversation, coffee drinking, and so
forth, they finally asked the proprietor if he
wished to buy any antiquities.</p>

<p class='c008'>“‘Certainly,’ he said, ‘if they are
genuine.’</p>

<p class='c008'>“‘Will you believe they are genuine if
you see them in position in the tomb in
which they were found?’ they asked.</p>

<p class='c008'>“‘Yes,’ he replied. ‘Have you got a
tomb?’</p>

<p class='c008'>“They said they had, and made arrangements
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>to take him to it at midnight, two or
three nights later.</p>

<p class='c008'>“When the night and the hour came, they
met at the appointed place and proceeded
towards the tomb. On the road there was
a fierce whispered alarm that the guards
were coming, and the party scattered in all
directions. The next night a second appointment
was made, and this time the party
reached the entrance to the tomb. The
doorway was blocked up, except for a small
hole, and sealed with what seemed to be
ancient mud-plaster. They tore down this
block and entered the tomb, a large rock-cut
chamber, literally filled with antiquities—stelæ,
ushebti, coffins, vases, and other objects,
apparently covered with the dust of ages.</p>
<p class='c014'>PLATE XIV.</p>

<div class='ic001'>
<p><span class='small'>A PIECE OF MUMMY CASE.<br />This is new wood made up to represent a part of a genuine mummy case.</span></p>
</div>
</div>
<p class='c014'>“The party then adjourned to Luxor to
discuss the price. The dealer finally bought
the lot for something like £600, and was
obliged to raise a mortgage on some property
in order to get the money. After great
difficulties in avoiding the guards, the objects
were finally transferred from the tomb to
the dealer’s house in Luxor. The summer
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>passed in pleasant dreams of winter profits,
and finally the first Museum buyer arrived
on the scene. The dealer selected a stone
from the purchased lot, and carried it round
to the house of a friend where the Egyptologist
happened to be engaged in negotiations
for the purchase of some antiquities. The
dealer called his friend to the door, and asked
him to show the stelæ to the buyer. His
friend smiled and said, ‘It is a forgery.’</p>

<p class='c008'>“The dealer laughed in derision, and insisted
on the stone being shown to the
expert, who took one look at it and said,
‘Rank forgery.’</p>

<p class='c008'>“The dealer, who had found this in what
seemed to be an untouched tomb, now
became thoroughly alarmed. At his request,
his friend and the Egyptologist went to his
house to inspect all the objects from the
tomb. They were all forgeries, and the
dealer had been swindled out of his £600
by a cleverly-planned trick of the west
bank forgers.”</p>

<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c008'>The Egyptians who are engaged in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>making of spurious antiquities are now
specialising. One man in Luxor has perfected
the manufacture of glazed or faience
vessels. Another at Qeneh has developed
the cutting and inscription of stone scarabs.
At Aboutig a forger makes woodwork and
carved ivories, and somewhere in Egypt they
are making stone vessels of all periods, apparently
on a steam lathe, but copying the
ancient forms with great success. A dealer
in Cairo once showed me an enormous head of
Amenemhat III., which he said was offered to
him as coming from Tanis. This must have
been the work of European stone-masons.
It was cut from a single large boulder of
sandstone, an exact copy of the existing
portraits of that king, but the cutting had
been done with modern stone-masons’ tools,
the marks of which were plainly visible,
even without a glass.</p>

<p class='c008'>“On another occasion,” Dr. Reisner tells
us, “I was once looking through the stock of
a dealer, now dead. Suddenly I caught sight
in the back of a drawer of what appeared
to be a Babylonian object. The dealer,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>who happened to know that I have some
knowledge of Babylonian antiquities, was
very reluctant to show me the object, protesting
openly that it was a forgery. I
persuaded him, however, and he produced
a dozen or more very beautifully made
Babylonian sculptures, but all perfectly
impossible. He said that he received them
from a Persian, an agent who came through
Cairo every year, and left him a certain
number of pieces to sell on commission. I
tried to buy one of these pieces, offering
even as high as £5 for it, against the £40
he demanded, but he refused. When I
came back in the spring, he told me with
a grin that he had sold them all at his own
price to various travellers.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I afterwards learned the forger’s name,
and that he lived in Baghdad, from an excavator
who had been working in Mesopotamia.
This man also forged cuneiform tablets, and
I have seen examples of his work in other
shops in Cairo besides the one I have mentioned.
He first began his forgery of the
cuneiform tablets by making moulds of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>two sides, pressing clay into the moulds and
sticking the two halves together before
baking. These forgeries were always discernible
by the shallowness of the little
wedges of which the writing is composed.
This seems to have been pointed out to him,
for after a time he began going over these
tablets with a pointed stick before baking,
and thus deepening the wedges. Finally,
with the practice thus gained, he even went
so far as to copy tablets freehand; and I
know of at least one large tablet in a
European museum which he made freehand
without any tablet to copy from. It has
all the appearance of one of the great
tablets from the temple at Telloh, but the
writing has no meaning.”</p>

  <h2 id='ch12' class='c007'>CHAPTER XII<br /> <br />THE MAKERS AND SELLERS OF<br />FORGED ANTIQUITIES</h2>
</div>
<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>As</span> I have already said, the majority of the
makers of forged antiquities are to be found
among the very adaptable “up-river men.”</p>
<p class='c008'>At Qus lives the maker of gold reproductions.
Most of the wooden forgeries
come from Gurna and the scarabs from
Luxor. In the villages near to Deir-el-Bahari
are made the porcelain vases and
figures, whence come also the stone heads
and statuettes. A number of composition
figures are made in the Delta, and may be
met with at Zagazig and Benha.</p>

<p class='c008'>A few years ago the forgers used to make
and sell their own work, but now that they
are becoming rich and rising in the social
scale they are content to leave the selling
part of the business to others and themselves
stay at home to carry on the making
of further imitations.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>In appearance they are tall, broad-shouldered
men with keen, clever faces and
long soft fingers, direct descendants of the
ancient Egyptians, with very dark skins,
thin lips and persuasive manners.</p>

<p class='c008'>One member of the family usually leaves
his village in the month of October, and
with his bundles of carefully wrapped up
reproductions drifts lazily down the Nile
on a trading boat. Arrived at Cairo, he
takes up his quarters with a friend, and the
next day may be seen in one of the principal
streets with his hands full of strings of
beads and his pockets bulging with some of
the results of the summer’s work.</p>

<p class='c008'>Dressed in a dark blue galabeyah, with a
white turban and red slippers, he makes an
imposing figure. He has a smattering of
various languages, in which “Real antīcas,
gentleman,” looms large. Also he has an
intimate knowledge of the various coinages
and generally manages to come out on the
right side in making a deal—at least, I
never heard of one who owned to the
contrary. He possesses largely the gift of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>perseverance and is like a sleuth-hound in
tracking down a possible purchaser. In
this he is assisted by the bowabs and servants,
many of whom are his own blood-relations
or friends.</p>

<p class='c008'>It must be remembered that most of the
servants in Egypt are Berberines, from
Nubia, and as the cultivable land up the
Nile is in places reduced to a few hundred
yards, and travelling by boat is cheap, it
will be seen that the men can easily get to
know each other well even though miles
of the Nile waterway may separate the
villages.</p>

<p class='c008'>But the “up-river man” is not the only
itinerant seller of antiquities. A donkey
boy may have found out that he can make
more money by selling antīcas to his patrons
than he can by running after his donkey,
even though the bakshīsh be included; so
he ponders over this until it becomes an
obsession and fills his thoughts day and
night. No longer will he remain a donkey
boy, he determines; he has a good arbeyah
or cloak and decent slippers, and a long
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>black cloak will hide a multitude of unwashedness.</p>

<p class='c008'>Visions of untold wealth spread themselves
out before him. A man he has heard
of got £12,000 for a papyrus, and £40 for
a gold-mounted scarab is an ordinary price.
By a merciful dispensation, Allah has given
the Nazarenes into the hands of the Faithful.
So he chooses riches; for, after all, money
means strength and honour in his village,
and perhaps—who knows?—one or more
wives who will be beautiful as the houris of
Paradise of whom he heard the Mullah
discourse in the mosque only the last Friday.
The prospect is dazzling and fills the boy’s
brain. Rich and powerful, men will look
up to him with respect, he will possess
feddans of land and children will rise up
around him.</p>

<p class='c008'>He clasps his hands and looks at a donkey
distastefully. Did he ever run miles across
the desert behind such uncleanliness? Why,
even Allah had named it “ass,” which
means, as he has been told, “a fool” in the
language of those who buy antīcas. Why
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>had he slumbered and why had his eyes
been shut in the past? Here was wealth,
only waiting for him to seize it. It was not
too late; he would force fortune to come
to him.</p>

<p class='c008'>So thinking, the boy sat gazing with unseeing
eyes at the scene before him. Girls
passed and giggled. “He hath seen an
Afrit,” said one. “Nay, a woman hath cast
her eyes on him,” said another. He heard
and frowned, then bending forward, took up
a stone and threw it at a passing dog. The
yelp of pain brought him back from the
dream world. His resolve was taken; he
would become an antīca-seller and, “Inshallah,”
might perhaps reap fortune at one
swoop.</p>

<p class='c008'>So the plunge is taken, the summer is
spent in gathering together his materials
and arranging to sell for others on commission;
and the following season the erstwhile
donkey boy, his pockets bulging with
small tin boxes containing his wares, haunts
the neighbourhood of the hotels where live
the buyers of antiquities.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>Genuine antiquities are few and not to be
had without considerable outlay, so in the
boxes mixed with the real fragments lie the
imitations.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was just such a boy as this who came
to my notice some years ago, and one day
I saw him arrested by the police and conveyed
to the Caracol (police station). Upon
making inquiries I was informed that he had
been taken up for annoying people by
pestering them to buy scarabs. Later in
the day I saw him leaning disconsolately
against a wall outside the Caracol.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, how much have you to pay?” I
asked.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Fifteen piastres” (about three shillings),
was his reply. “Or”—and he shrugged
his shoulders—“or I stay three days in
prison.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Have you paid the money?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why not?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I have none.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Now this was untrue, for, otherwise, how
could he give change to purchasers?—and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>these boys will rarely risk losing a sale for the
want of change. This I pointed out to him,
and spoke of the shame, but he shook his
head obstinately. Prison has no taint for
these men, it is merely an incident in the
day’s work. On the following morning,
when he was to surrender, I saw him again,
his pockets no longer bulging, his clothes
clean washed, his cloak brushed, and wearing
his new red slippers. He was going to prison.</p>

<p class='c008'>Calling him to me, I handed over the
amount of the fine, saying, “Go and pay it
at once and get to work again.” The boy
looked sullenly at the three shillings; it
was a lot of money to give to the prison
authorities, and that was not the way to
get rich. Then he saluted and walked away.</p>

<p class='c008'>After three days he returned and asked
to see me. Solemnly he produced a piece
of dirty rag, untied it, and handed me back
the three shillings.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What is this?” I asked.</p>

<p class='c008'>The boy grinned. “Well you see, sir,
when I got to the prison, the officer who
takes the money had gone away. I waited
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>there for one day, and then he came back.
When I pay the money I give him two
shillings, but he look at a paper and say
‘Three.’ I say ‘No; three shillings or
three days in prison. You were away when
I come. I stop here one day, and here
are two shillings.’ He say, ‘No, three.’
Then I wrap up the money and stay two
more days in prison; after that I come out,
and here is your money.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Obviously there was only one thing to be
done, and he departed with a broad smile
and the conviction that he had done a good
day’s work. One cannot help feeling that
such a boy ought to succeed.</p>

<p class='c008'>On another occasion I saw the same
youth strolling about his village when I
knew that he should have been in prison
for a contravention of the law. Calling
him, I inquired how this came about.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I have business in my village,” he said,
“so my brother he come to the prison and
take my place. I give the policeman one
shilling, I come out to do my business, then
go back again.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>Let me say that this took place years ago,
and I do not think he would get out of
prison so easily now; but even quite
recently I heard of a sale of antiquities
running into hundreds of pounds, one of
the parties to the transaction being in
prison at the time.</p>

<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c008'>Then there are the more prosperous sellers
with their feet firmly set in the path to
fortune, who combine the selling of forged
antiquities with dealings in the real articles.
Sometimes a dragoman varies his legitimate
business by bringing before the notice of his
party antiquities which he declares are
genuine, or introduces a seller, who at the
conclusion of the bargain hands over to the
dragoman a fair percentage of the spoils.
His part in the transaction may be limited
to the introduction of the seller and the
assurance that “This man very good man,
dig in the tombs, lady. Don’t be afraid, he
very honest.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Lastly there is the polished seller, tired
of mien, suave of manner and high in price,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>producing only upon pressure his store of
treasures. Apparently casual about selling
anything, he is probably the most dangerous,
for if no business is done, one leaves him
feeling very mean, and conscious of having
committed an offence in doubting the
authenticity of the articles shown by him.</p>

<p class='c008'>Nor does the silence of your guide on the
way home tend to relieve the feeling of
oppression and smallness, until perhaps by
some good fortune one meets a man who
knows; then the feeling changes to one of
relief at the escape and wrathfulness at the
attempt that has been made to swindle
you.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>It</span> would not, perhaps, be out of place to
make some special reference to the men
who are doing so much to throw light upon
the thoughts and lives of the old Egyptians;
but here is need to tread as warily as may
be, for these are a race apart. Charming
companions they are, delightful hosts, brilliant
guests, generous and painstaking to
a degree when once you have presented your
card and asked to be shown around. So
clever are they that after a time one learns
wisdom, and refrains from advancing theories
in their presence as to how the old Egyptians
cut and worked their diorite, granite, and
other hard stones: what lights they used
when making and painting the tombs in the
Valley of the Kings: or what system of
mechanics they employed in raising blocks
of stone weighing many tons to the tops of
the Pyramids, 480 feet up: if it was an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>inclined plane, cradles, or levers, or what it
was? These men have seen many workmen
hard put to it to pull a small granite statue
weighing three or four tons up an inclined
plane of less than 45 degrees. And yet what
wonderful patience and courtesy most of
these experts show to well-meaning but
ignorant questioners, even when they are
perhaps burning to be free to turn back
more pages of hidden history.</p>
<p class='c008'>There is something about them which
seems strange to new-comers. Perhaps,
indeed probably, it is the inhalation and
absorption of the desiccated and pulverised
remains of the ancient Egyptians which
influences them. Every one knows that
the dust from tombs produces irritation
of the air passages, and possibly this also
accounts for the divergence of opinion among
them; for never yet have I known two
Egyptologists agree absolutely upon a given
subject. I have heard a story that two
savants read an inscription, the one beginning
from right to left, and the other from
left to right, and both made sense of it.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>I was somewhat surprised recently by the
remarks of a learned friend to me.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You are getting more and more like an
Egyptian. I notice the change every time
I see you,” he said. It may be so, although
the idea is startling. We know that Continents
produce types, of which fact a good
example is America. Then add to this the
daily dose of ancient Egyptian remains, and
the mystery is one no longer, but the effect
becomes possible if not probable. Among
the savants some of the old characteristics
reappear to-day. Listen to the speech of
Amenemhat to his son, Sesostris, during the
twelfth dynasty.</p>

<p class='c014'>The spirit of these sayings creeps into the
work, and excavators may be trusted to
keep their own counsel. They will take
immense trouble and pains in their explanations,
and endeavour to render into popular
language the hieroglyphics, and the meanings
of the dead past; but let the ignorant only
intrude upon a piece of their sacred earth,
and “ice is not in it with them.” Once,
while going through some excavations, a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>friend pointed out a small blue bead lying
on the top of one of the low mud walls
which separate tomb from tomb. “Shall
I steal it?” he asked. Knowing the
ways of excavators, I whispered a warning,
“Better not.” A few steps further on the
excavator turned round and explained
pointedly, “Every article found in the
diggings is taken note of; even a small
bead” (here he paused, and we felt uncomfortable)
“is placed on the top of the
wall near where it was found, and is catalogued
in its turn.” After this little admonition
upon righteousness, we walked thoughtfully
along, and my friend edged up to me.
“Good job I did not steal it,” he whispered.
“I am perfectly certain he” (indicating the
excavator) “did not hear what I said to
you, unless he has ears as well as eyes in the
back of his head.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Excavators are, as a rule, extremely good
judges of humanity. They know that an
ancient predatory instinct is present in
most people of the Anglo-Saxon race, and
who knows how many short lectures on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>honesty that one small blue bead gave rise
to. But even excavators, or perhaps it is
more correct to say some of them, have their
failings. They are apt to look down from an
immense height upon an amateur digger as
something too ignorant for words; and a
pained look comes over their faces when you
mention the work done by So-and-so, and the
conclusions to which he has come. “What
is the country coming to?” their expression
seems to say.</p>

<p class='c008'>But the excavators have their trials
too. Sometimes a digger has been working
for weeks at some deep burial pit. Suppose
now that “something” has been found.
Perhaps a door is about to be opened. At
the critical moment, some tourists appear on
the scene. The unearthing or opening must
stop, for who knows what may be found, and
the greatest care must be taken to get full
notes and photographic records, that nothing
may be lost. The afternoon passes, and night
begins to come on. It is too late now to
open the find, it must wait, strongly guarded
from thieves, till to-morrow; and the excavator
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>passes an uneasy night, pondering
and wondering what he will find, and saying
evil things about those who hindered him
in his work.</p>

<p class='c008'>I have been in the habit of showing my
forged antiquities to Egyptologists, not
bumptiously, but humbly, and with a due
knowledge of my own colossal ignorance.
The specimen would be passed across the
table in silence, accompanied by a magnifying
glass. The expert would frown heavily,
but the specimen and the glass would, in
the end, prove irresistible. As I produced
scarabs made more perfect, a certain uneasiness
would be shown, and the question
asked me, “Is this genuine or not?” To
this I would never reply otherwise than to
say, “I should be glad to have your opinion
on the matter.” A very careful examination
of the specimen would follow, and the reasons
for considering it to be a forgery would be
explained in terse plain language.</p>

<p class='c008'>There is a certain disadvantage in collecting
spurious antiquities and getting expressions
of opinion upon them; for after a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>time your association with these forgeries
causes an inclination in the expert to condemn
off-hand any specimen you may submit
to him. To meet this occasionally I would
hand over a genuine scarab, which would
be detected, and inquiry made as to “what
I was up to now, or whether I had really
bought this as a fraudulent antiquity?”
Occasionally remarks would be pointed,
and expressed in the bluff way which “hides
a heart of gold.” This I always accepted
humbly, conscious of my own inferiority.</p>

<p class='c008'>These experts were goodness itself, and
would spend hours over a close examination
of a specimen submitted to them. On one
occasion, when showing the figure seen on
page 54, the excavator demanded “where
on earth” I had obtained it? Filled with
the spirit of mischief, I refused to answer,
but dropped vague hints about black granite
statues, life size; at which he turned round,
saying crossly, “Really, I believe you are
in league with every disreputable person
in the country.” Modestly I disclaimed
this, and pointed out that I was actuated
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>simply and solely by a zeal for science.
I asked him if he would be kind enough
to read the inscription upon the tablet
before him. This he was unable to do
himself, but he made a copy which he
took away for a friend to read. Day after
day went past, and the translation did
not arrive. After about a week or ten
days, I reminded him, but for some reason
or other, the translation was not forthcoming.
Weeks after, I learnt that my friend
had been afraid to hand the inscription to
the man whom he knew could read it,
lest it should be a further trick on my
part, and should contain nothing more
than a message of thanks from a grateful
patient.</p>

<p class='c008'>On another occasion I made an experiment
as to whether my association with
modern forged antiquities would be sufficient
to bias an expert in expressing his opinion
as to the genuineness of articles of known
antiquity submitted to him.</p>

<p class='c008'>I obtained four specimens (<i>see</i> <a href='#plate-16'>Plate XVI</a>),
of undoubted antiquity, although even these
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>are examples made in or for Nubia about
3500 years ago of Egyptian Funerary objects of
New Empire period (reign of Thothmes III).</p>

<p class='c008'>The largest scarab is of very poor workmanship.
The head, which took the unusual
form of a sphinx, was badly made and proportioned,
and was turned slightly to one
side. The workmanship of the smaller
scarab was also poor. The sacred eye was
well made, of a beautiful blue, and looked
as if it had only just left the workshop.
The monkey was one of the most startling
things I have ever seen found in an excavation
in Egypt. The glaze was modern and the
whole thing looked as if it had recently
come out of a cheap bazaar. But there can
be no question about the authenticity of
these things, for they were found and taken
out of the graves by the archæologists of
the Nubian Survey.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>On the mantelpiece of a house in Egypt
stood a cheap ornament. This appears in
No. 2, side by side with the monkey found
in Nubia. The ancient specimen is much
the better work, but the likeness between
the two is so strong as to be absolutely
bewildering.</p>

<p class='c008'>[When the ancient monkey vase was first
found it was shown to an eminent Egyptologist,
not in the ordinary way as a
valuable antiquity, but a few matches
were placed in it (<i>see</i> <a href='#plate-16'>No. 6</a>), and it was
put quietly upon the table in front of
him in the evening when the party were
smoking. However, he was not to be taken
in, but at once recognised it as a valuable
antīca.]</p>

<p class='c008'>Entering casually into conversation with
my friend, I led up to the subject of antiquities.
He was expressing his views freely,
and I waited patiently. During a pause I
slipped my hand into my pocket, brought out
one of the specimens and pushed it across the
table towards him. A scornful smile came
over his face. “One of your forgeries, I
suppose,” he remarked. I said, “I should
like to have your opinion on the object.” He
examined it carefully, and then laid it down.
I passed another across to him, and then the
remaining two. One by one he discarded
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>them, giving it as his opinion that the large
scarab was a forgery for the following very
sound reasons, bearing in mind the excellence
of the old Egyptians’ work. The
inscription, he said, was not very well done:
the two holes on the side were not usual in
heart scarabs: the head was badly made
and turned to one side; the work on the
feet was clumsy. The small scarab he classed
as imitation for the following reasons. The
two antelopes are supposed to be alike, but
one is larger than the other, and has a larger
neck and ears. The branches of a tree over
the back of the antelopes were irregular
in size, one being small and one large. A
round eye appears on the under surface of
the scarab, which should have had a
duplicate on the opposite side. The
back and head, he decided, were very
good.</p>

<p class='c008'>The monkey, which was shown to him
with a few matches placed in the receptacle
before it, was declared to be a shameless
fraud, and he wondered that I should take
up my time in collecting such obvious
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>imitations. When he was shown the photograph
which had been taken of a common
vase from the mantelpiece of a house, and
compared it with the specimen he was
examining, he sarcastically inquired if I
bought all my antiquities in a cheap Jack’s
booth at home. Meekly I produced the
sacred eye, which he would scarcely deign
to look at, contemptuously pushing it aside
on account of a small white mark in the
blue. “Have you got any more?” he
inquired. Modestly I said that I had not,
when, with some muttered remarks about
the strangeness of the pursuits taken up by
people with more time on their hands than
sense, he strode away.</p>

<p class='c008'>There had gathered round us a little silent
group of listeners who seemed rather to
sympathise with me, although, of course,
thinking that I had brought all this upon
myself.</p>

<p class='c008'>Presently one of these bystanders said:
“Does not a monkey appear in Plate 72,
Vol. I., of the ‘Archæological Survey of
Nubia?’” There was a dead silence, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>many inquiring eyes were turned upon me.
I said, “That is so.” Then another man
said, “It is described as a steatite monkey
holding a kohl pot, for I remember reading
it with great interest. And the sacred eye
is shown in Plate 79, Vol. I.” Now the
interest became intense, and smiles began
to appear on the faces of the bystanders.
It was all true. The small scarab is shown
in the second volume, and the large scarab
is illustrated in the second report of the
“Archæological Survey of Nubia.”</p>

<p class='c008'>It was, perhaps, an unkind experiment to
make, but yet it was necessary to know
whether one’s association with admitted
forgeries were sufficient to bias the mind
of a clever man in giving his opinion on
specimens submitted to him.</p>

<p class='c008'>Ten years ago, when discussing with an
eminent excavator the excellence of the
fourth dynasty work, I said: “Here we have
the climax, so to speak, of Egyptian culture—the
period of the Great Pyramid of Cheops,
which is so marvellous for the mathematical
exactitude with which it is built. But where
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>are the evidences of the evolution which preceded
this period, the time when they were
trying their dawning ideas? No architect
would have dared offer to build Cheops a
pyramid, the base of which should be
thirteen acres in extent and 480 feet in
height, were he not absolutely certain of
his ability to overcome those mathematical
and mechanical difficulties which would
be met with in lifting heavy blocks of
stone 480 feet. And then the sides face
due North and South, East and West.
Where is the period of evolution which
preceded this excellence?”</p>

<p class='c008'>The excavator’s reply was startling. “I
do not believe that there was one,” he said.
“The demand was made and met: the same
would be the case to-day if a similar need
arose.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Perhaps this explains why Egyptians,
without preliminary tuition in sculpture
or painting, are copying the old work in
such a way that only the most experienced
are able to tell the real from the
false.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>Most excavators, however, have a sense
of intuition which tells them if a thing is
false or not. Not that they depend in any
way upon this, for they weigh up the evidence
in a strictly scientific manner, and give their
decision backed up by reasons which are
difficult to dispute.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
